Sentence
Love these. Was looking for converses and these were half the price and so unique— I’ve never seen clear shoes like these; they fit great. The plastic takes a little getting used to but the style is so worth it.
"The shoes are very cute, but after the 2nd day of wearing them the tongue started ripping. After the 3rd day of wearing them the plastic on the side ripped. They could have ripped bc I was wearing them to work and I do a lot of walking at work. If you’re going to buy these I don’t recommend wearing them on days where you will do a lot of walking or they might rip"
Good quality
Great
"Ho scelto il modello bianco con rifinitura dietro nera e posso dire che da vicino le scarpe sono ancora più belle, il mio numero è 38, 38.5 ed ho ordinato il numero 38 e mi va bene..Spedizione veloce, il pacco è arrivato anche prima del previsto, prezzo ottimo dato che in giro costano almeno 10, 15 euro in più."
"Sono solita comprare scarpe Guess e non ho mai avuto problemi con la taglia, in questo caso, invece, mi sono arrivate delle scarpe che, nonostante fossero il solito numero che prendo, sono molto piccole, sembra quasi due numeri meno, quindi immettibili"
"Le scarpe sono molto belle, calzano perfettamente"
"Semplicemente perfette. Io uso plantari su misura per piede piatto, e dentro queste scarpe ci stanno perfettamente. La scarpa è comoda e da una buona stabilità al piede. Le consiglio"
"Le scarpe sono bellissime, arrivate in perfetto stato con una spedizione impeccabile, purtroppo il 41 mi andava stretto e non fanno il 42 le ho dovute restituire, il venditore disponibile e gentile"
Le scarpe sono ben fatte e il venditore molto preciso perchè ho dovuto fare un reso e mi ha rimborsato perfettamente. Bravo. Resta nei preferiti.
Der Schuh 👟gefällt mir sehr gut. Der ist super bequem und leicht. Binsehr zu frieden. Danke
"Scarpa perfetta e davvero molto bella la mia ragazza ha apprezzato, venditore molto disponibile !!"
"Stupende,forse un po' troppo grandi,ma sicuramente ho sbagliato io"
"Molto bello proprio come nelle foto , comode e puoi abbinarci qualsiasi cosaSuper sodisfatta grazie"
"True to size. If between I'd probably go with your lower end i.e 8-8.5 go 8. I wore these right out of the box for a little over 2 hours, most of which was walking around and they were incredibly comfortable no rubbing and I did not find any issue with the tongue being too stiff as I have seen mentioned in other reviews."
This is the second pair I bought. Loved the first pair however not pleased with the 2nd pair. There is no padding in the tongue part of the shoe and it is causing irritation to my skin where it rubs. I am very disappointed and will not buy them again.
"I love these shoes so much, it's my second pair, pure comfort!  Thank you Amazon!"
"I have hard to fit feet and often a wide fitting shoe looks too big and bulky.  These shoes were comfortable right away with no pressure points.  I use them for run around shoes, going to the store, etc.  They look casual but are more attractive than a running shoe.  They have a nice rounded toe box and go with any kind of outfit.  I am very happy with them."
足が22cmのため、このサイズを展開しているブランドが少なく購入。デザインは可愛くて満足だが、履き心地は残念。小さいサイズあるあるで、パーツは大きいサイズのものを流用しているように思える。・ベロが長すぎて、足首を曲げるたびにこすれて、すり傷ができる（スニーカーソックスではNG）・インソールの踵から土踏まずのアーチまでの距離が長すぎて、つま先寄りにアーチが来るため、後ろ重心に感じる今回は靴下や中敷きを工夫して履こうと思うが、可愛くてもリピートはしない。
"I really need 11 1/2 but these shoes do not come in half sizes.  My right foot fits size 11 fine but not the same for the left foot.  The only issue is the blue insole - my feet perspire and the blue colour runs into my socks.  Also, the round laces look nice but they do not remain tied; they need a knot in the bow to maintain the tie.  They are very attractive shoes and do not look huge in size 12. Thank you. CHL."
最初少し硬かったけど、すぐに履きやすくなり、軽くて歩きやすいです！
Great quality and comfort shoesI was so thrilled when I got my new shoes last week! I had bought a pair of a RAVON shoes over two years ago at an expensive shoe store and I did not regret spending the money because they were perfect walking shoes and they gave me plenty of support and I have a bunion on my left big toe and I had plenty of room for that foot. Tmy new ones just like my old pair as far as being comfortable and they keepI got me balanced. By the way my original pair that are 2 1/2 years old are still good but I am using them to mow grass in because I feel safe walking in them. I wanted new ones because I needed some pretty ones that weren’t grungy looking. I am 67And being balanced is ver  important to me. I highly recommend these shoes because of the wonderful quality and comfort and I got them on sale! What a deal so I feel like I won the lottery! Also I neglected to mention they are very classy looking. Very well-made and beautiful and striking.
I would NOT recommend these for running. They have zero support and I could feel the rocks in the ground through the shoe. They are also shaped really weird. The sole protrudes out in the back all around the heel and makes your foot appear much larger than it should.
"These shoes are cute online but in person...not so much.The shoe is super light weight and flimsy feeling.  Because of this, it feels as if there is no support/stability.My partial orthotic fit well into the heel of the shoe.The shoe not only has aqua-colored accents (shoe string eyelets) but also has an aqua liner throughout the shoe. As I was slipping my socked foot into the shoe for the first time, that inner liner sort of bunched up and made the shoe top look distorted. As if the liner pushed forward and down causing the upper portion and toe of the shoe to twist upward.  Not a nice look.  At that point I decided that I didn't want to struggle with getting the shoe on each time.  I'm returning them."
"Very comfortable! Absolutely love the look and feel of these shoes. They run slightly too big. But, that doesn't take away from the comfort. I'm not sliding around inside them. I'm able to work in them well and workout in them great. Excellent pair of shoes."
"I like the style and weight of this shoe, just right for wearing all day.  Good quality components.  However, as other reviewers have said, the insole makes wearing these shoes impossible.  The surface of the insoles is some attractive suede fabric which looks like it will be very comfortable.  In fact, the fabric prevents your foot from sliding into the shoe.  I forced my feet in and my toes were uncomfortably turned in on them selves, I could not possibly wear these shoes like that.  I tried stockings and different types of socks with the same difficulty, I just could not push my foot smoothly into the shoe.  Then I tried taking the insole out of another pair of sneakers and putting them in the Aragon’s.  My foot slid right in but when I walked there was no arch support.  Dilemma, should I send them back or go buy 6 or 7 sets of insoles at the drug store to see if any of them will work.  So disappointing."
"The tongue is long, stiff, and rough. It rubs my ankles raw."
"I have been trying to find a casual, but not too casual, shoe for work. I wanted an athletic shoe fit in a shoe that doesn't look like an athletic shoe. This is pretty close. It works well with chinos or colored denim. They would not look right with ""dress"" pants, but for business casual, it's good. I'm always between 8 and 8.5. I went with an 8 and they fit perfectly.  I also need good support and these are reasonable. I have another pair of Aravon shoes (mary jane) and they also work well. I think this is good brand."
I thought they were really cute and fit good but after I decided to wear them around for a day I mopped the floor like I Do every day and I almost slipped so the shoes will not be good for me and my lifestyle very slippery pretty much no tread it would be good for walking as long as you’re never honest with Service but I wouldn’t want to take my chances so back to Searching for a new pair of shoes
"I'd give them 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that the material on the inside of the shoe keeps pulling on my socks, it's not all the time, but it's frequent enough with certain socks that it becomes annoying to have to stop and pull my socks up which find their way down into my shoes after walking for 10-15 min, also the laces don't seem to stay tied, my recommendation is to buy socks that are really snug around your ankles and use a different pair of laces.... besides that, I think the shoes are really cute, love the choice of brown and blue, I think they work well together, also the shoe has pretty good support, I use my own inserts which fit well in the shoe, but like I said if you don't, the original inserts are pretty good"
I bought these as a birthday present for myself. I originally wanted to use them as my new jogging shoes. The tongue of the shoe is just too stiff for that though. I am still happy with the shoes cuz they are super cute. Besides the stiff tongue my only other complaint is they seem a tad larger than my other size tens. I have a little more space than I like to have. Otherwise completely awesome!
"I was so excited to find these shoes. They are super cute!  They were too small, however, and I cannot find the larger size I need.  When I tried them on, they were really stiff and a bit tight.  Who knows maybe they would stretch out as I wore them, but they just didn't fit.  I am disappointed that I can't find the size I need anywhere, but will keep looking."
"It's a very comfortable and lightweight shoe.  I found it to be pretty true for a size 10, but all shoes run differently.  Other reviews said it ran small, but I didn't find that the case. I bought the 10D width.  The wider width doesn't look odd, it fits the shoe well and my foot."
Two years ago I bought this same exact shoes.  I wore them always when choosing a stylish athletic shoe. Originally I bought them when our family was going to go to The Ark in Kentucky and knew we would be doing alot of walking.there has never been a time that my feet hurt when I wear these shoes. And I get compliments often as to how cute they look.  So best shoes for me for comfort and style! Bought them again to update and bought an additional pair in black.
"An sich wunderschöner Schuh, auspacken und direkt meinem Kind angezogen. Das Kind geht 2 Schritte und fängt bitterlich an zu weinen... Sofort Schuhe ausgezogen und mal geschaut was da los ist. Es war nen für Kleinkinderschuhe wirklich großer Knick in der Inneneinlage der sich auch nicht wirklich begradigen lässt. Bedauerlich, wo doch der Schuh an sich nicht im Discounter Sektor liegt. Da hätte ich wirklich mehr erwartet."
Auf einem der Fotos steht auf der Sohle die gr 26.Die Schuhe die mit verschickt wurden ist die Gr 19...Habe keine Antwort auf meine Frage vor einigen  Tagen bekommen welche Größe das tatsächlich ist.
"Grandson couldn't even get them on, they are so tightly cut."
"The laces broke after slightly over one week of use. Horrible quality. Before it broke, my son complained it was very uncomfortable, as the metal grommets on the sides rub against the side of his foot."
Nice pair of shoes
"These shoes are cute and jus fine. I wanted to comment on the company actually. I bought these for a wedding for my son to wear and they weren’t going to arrive in time.  I reached out to Amazon with no luck. I finally contacted the company directly and they said they didn’t think they could get them to me in time because of how the process works. However, I literally received these the very next day. Whoever I spoke to, thank you, you obviously went out of your way to get these pulled and shipped to me and I can’t thank you enough. They made it on time and the wedding was gorgeous!!My son kept the shoes on all night and now wears them when he wants to dress up casual  ..he says they are comfy and shoe laces are long enough he can tie them easily"
"When my 8 year old asked for “skate shoes”, I could only picture AirWalks or Vans (which are cute, but don’t fit their wide feet well). I began searching and found these. They are not just skate shoes, but also adorable and good, Adidas quality."
"Great looking shoe at a great price! I got these in the gray with black stripes and the black with white stripes. Looks exactly like the ones I got from the store that were $20 more. They run big. I wear a women’s 7 in most shoes. I measured my foot on the big kids Adidas size chart and according to it, I should get a 6.5. I got the 6 because they didn’t have any other sizes and based on other reviews from women I was hoping they would work out. They’re big. I measured them against the men’s 7 I had from the store and there wasn’t much difference between the 6 and 7. They measured the same as the men’s 6.5 I had from the store. I would’ve ordered a 5 if they were available. It’s hard to guess with the weird sizing situation. Hopefully putting in some insoles will help because I want to keep them."
Very nice shoes. Got them when they were on sale and they are really nice.
The shoes fit as expected. I bought these for my seven year old son. He loves how comfortable they are. Definitely worth the buy!
Kid loves them. Good fit and comfortable.
These shoes fit well and are comfortable.
"My son likes it. However he said it's heavy. Other than that, it's a great shoe."
"Brought these for my grandson,  and I'm told it fits him perfectly and he loves them.  He don't ever want to take them off."
Die Oberfläche ist sehr empfindlich und sieht nicht lange schön aus wenn man Jungs hat die gerne draußen toben
厚底とアーチが足を前に出す機能をゆっくり走る時に強く効果を感じますね。ただ初の厚底だったので、走る環境も考えて走らないといけないと思います。いつも通りに走ってしまうと着地不安定となり転倒してしまうかもしれません。転倒して顔面強打、頬骨ヒビ入りましたので、慎重に徐々に慣らしていきましょう。
23、5は小さすぎたので交換してもらいました。
Eigentlich ein ganz toller und bequemer Schuh von Superfit. Ich weiß nicht warum der Hersteller die Sohle so billig hergestellt hat. Nach ein paar mal anziehen ging die weiße Schukappe schon ab. Sollte bei teuren Markenschuhen ein No-Go sein.
Komfort und perfekt schucse
"Ein wunderschöner Lederschuh, der allerdings deutlich schmäler ausfällt. Eigentlich trägt unser Sohn die mittlere Breite, hier handelt es sich eher um die schmale Ausführung. Daher ging der Schuh leider retour. Sehr ungewöhnlich für Superfit"
Unser Tochter (20 M) zieht diese Schuhe sehr gerne an und läuft damit auch gerne herum.Abgesehen davon ist Farbe/Modell sehr schön!
Beste Schuhe von Superfit generell. Wir sind immer zufrieden und dieser Schuh gefällt mir persönlich sehr gut
"Super, hochwertiger Kinderschuh. Meine Tochter fährt voll darauf ab."
Muy cómodo para el Niño
It’s a tight fit! The top part doesn’t open so it made  it super hard for my son to get the shoe on. We ended up returning the shoes! If #Puma will make it so that the top part can open and then possible Velcro closed or maybe zipper it would be awesome so kids can easily slide their feet in!!
This product fits well but may not be ideal for a child that has wide feet. The strap across the top has some stretch but it is very thick and does not stretch easily which may make it difficult for a wider foot to get pass that section. The entire shoe is made very well.
Difficult to put on. They are too hard.
Son loves them and is willing to double up in sock layers to make fit. Would recommend going a half size down. My son is 4.5 big kids by size measurements but could easily have fit for a long while in a 4
My Grandson loves his Puma's and so do I ❣️
No complains
Muy lindos pero aprietan de la parte de Arriba
I order  a size 11 kids size shoes received  and 10 it's very tight on my child foot. elastic  that run across cant expands.  sorry I every purchased  this damn shoes
"Producto original, de buena calidad. Talla justa, Cumplió las expectativas."
Mein 4- jähriger Sohn liebt diese Stiefel und möchte seine anderen Schuhe nicht mehr tragen. Er hat in den Stiefeln keine Schweißfüße wie in einigen anderen Schuhen. Er läuft sehr gut  darin und hat auch bei eisigen Temperaturen keine kalten Füße. Die Stiefel sind meiner Meinung nach von einer sehr guten Qualität und deshalb etwas schwerer. Meinen Sohn stört das überhaupt nicht. Er kommt perfekt rein und wieder raus (das war bei anderen Stiefeln problematischer). Das Highlight für ihn ist natürlich das blinken. Ich werde die Stiefel auch wohl im nächsten Winter kaufen.
"Beck Gummistiefel begleiten uns nun schon einige Jahre. Passform super, vorallem, wenn die Füße etwas breiter geschnitten sind. Klare Kaufempfehlung. Die Leuchtfunktion beim Gehen ein Highlight für die Kleinen. Schuhe halten die Füße im Herbst und Winter schön warm. Wir haben dieses Modell schon das zweite Jahr im Einsatz."
"Habe die Gummistiefel für meine beiden Kinder gekauft. Und sie wurden ausgiebig im Urlaub, am Strand und in Pfützen, getestet. Die Gummistiefel haben den Test bestanden und bekommen 5 Sterne.★ entsprechen der angegebene Größe, genug Platz auch mit dicken Socken★ Wasserdicht★ halten kleine Füße warm und trocken★ schönes Design★ blinkende Sohle, sehr gut sichtbar im dunkelnKann diese Stiefel nur empfehlen 👍"
"Ich habe diese Gummistiefel nun das zweite Mal bestellt, aus den ersten ist mein Söhnchen herausgewachsen. Die Gummistiefel sind sehr robust: Sie haben ein ganzes Kindergartenjahr vergleichsweise gut überstanden! Sie halten warm und trocken. Es stimmt, dass die Stiefel etwas schwerer sind als andere Gummistiefel, aber meinen Sohn hat das nicht gestört oder beim Laufen behindert. Ein paar kleine Kritikpunkte: Die Blinkfunktion hat im Laufe des Jahres den Geist aufgegeben... auch riechen die Stiefel leicht nach Chemie, wenn sie noch ganz neu sind."
Die Gummistiefel sind sehr schön verarbeitet und unser Sohn liebt sie. Nebst der guten Verarbeitung ist der Leuchteffekt sehr ansprechend und unser Sohn ist gut zu sehen. Der Leuchteffekt bleibt auch bei starker Verschmutzung bestehen und die Schuhe lassen sich sehr gut reinigen.
"Mein Sohn ist sehr zufrieden. Die Stiefel sind gut verarbeitet und halten im Winter die Füsse schön trocken und warm. Sie sind von innen vollständig mit einem kuscheligen Kunstfell gefüttert und von außen im ganzen mit durchsichtigem Gummi überzogen. Das Dinosaurierskelettmuster ist schön und perfekt für alle Dinofans. Die Ferse blinkt beim gehen, was im dunklen Winter nur vom Vorteil sein kann. Der Stiefel fällt etwas groß aus. Sollte vielleicht lieber eine Größe kleiner bestellt werden. Alles im ganzen ein guter Wintergummistiefel zum relativ günstigen Preis."
"Sohnemann brauchte neue Gummistiefel und diese fand er optisch sehr schön, also bestellt.Leider passten die ersten nicht, weshalb wir sie dann nochmal größer bestellt haben.Er ist jetzt sehr zufrieden, sie blinken, halten trockenbund sind innen auch noch etwas flauschig und daher etwas wärmer als andere Stiefel."
"Resistentes, no entra agua los días de lluvia y con un diseño informal que tanto sirve para llevar con uniforme al colegio o para unos vaqueros en fin de semana. Perfectos"
"Die Stiefel sehen schön aus und die Blinklichter funktionieren einwandfrei. Allerdings sind die Stiefel schon ziemlich schwer und scheinen von der Passform nicht besonders gut zu sein. Mein Sohn hat es nach zwei Versuchen sein lassen, da er keinen guten halt hatte und somit nicht bequem damit laufen konnte."
"Very nice boots. I had hoped the shoe laces would be flexible and integrated like most Camper shoes. Here you get regular laces, and as such, you don't get the Camper 'feeling' or practicality of putting them on and off quickly. They are quite light, which is a plus."
die Lieferung kam sehr schnell und gut verpackt bei mir an.die Schuhe sind wie in den Angaben beschrieben.mein Kind hat sich sehr gefreut.ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Preis und der Qualität.
"Suuuuper bequeme Schuhe, mein Mann sagt, er läuft wie auf Wolken!Passen perfekt!"
Güzel bir yagmur çizmesi ama paket geldiginde actim ve hasarli oldugunu gördüm.. Kalite olarak güzelNeden göndermeden önce nce kontrolünü yapmıyorsunuz anlayamadim..
It took me a half hour to get these shoes on. Not practical. I returned the item and am still waiting for my refund.
"Sono rifiniti molto bene, la soletta e’ scamosciata, così il piede non suda. All’esterno sono di stoffa, ma all’interno, a contatto con la pelle, hanno un ulteriore rivestimento per proteggere il piedino.La calzata e’ regolare.Sono molto soddisfatta di questo acquisto 👍"
"Ho comprato questo sandali a mio figlio di 7 anni, devo dire che a lui piacciono tanto, ma calzano esatte, quindi consiglio un numero in più rispetto a quello del piede effettivo"
Scarpa molto carina e resistente. Mio figlio ci cammina e corre benissimo. Comode e pratiche da indossare. Soddisfatta anche del prezzo .
"OTTIMO PRODOTTO COME GARANTISCE LA STESSA MARCA, TAGLIA FEDELE AI CENTIMETRI"
"Non mi piacciano, non calzano bene, ho cambiato due volte i numeri prima uno più grande e poi uno più piccolo… maleInsoddisfatta ….le ho rese !!!!!"
"È possibile avere il reso, i sandali sono grandi e non vanno. È da due settimane che ho fatto richiesta ma non ho avuto nessuna risposta."
Sandali ottimi e corrispondenti alla descrizione. La taglia è precisa. La consegna è stata un po' ritardata perché mal gestita dal corriere.
"Pratico e confortevole, spesa contenuta per un buon prodotto."
Comodissimi ci cammino per chilometri
Ottimo acquisto. Sandalo comodo e ben strutturato. Bello esteticamente.Veste bene ma essendo aperto consiglio 1 misura in più.
"Ottime scarpe per allenamento e gare, leggere e stabili!"
très belle  chaussure tient bien le pied avec un amortie parfait pour des kms de footing  a recommander
１８キロほどを３回走りましたが、クッション性がよくて足裏の疲労度はさほどでもありませんでした。他の軽量の靴と比べると足へのダメージが少ない気がします。微妙な重さ（２６ｃｍで２２０グラムくらい）なので、もっと軽い靴が欲しい人にはホカオネオネのＲＩＮＣＯＮ３の方がいいかもしれません。ソールの踵に近い部分は３回目で少々ささくれ立っています。耐久性は期待しないほうがいいかも。親指にやんわりと「前に行け」という指令が入るようになっているので走りやすい靴ではあります。
価格が5000円台になったので購入しました。グライドライドよりかなり軽い感じですが、前方への進む感じはやや少ないように思います。スピード練習でも使えそうなので、サブ４用のトレーニングに使用開始しました。
"Muy cómodos para trote o caminatas, los recomiendo"
The shoe is responsive and that is good. But it would be better to have longer shoe laces
love my running shoes!!
"These were waaaay smaller than the size they were supposed to be.Cute shoes tho.i bought them for my 6 yr old ,but they fit my 4 yr old.so,if you order them,get them 2 sizes bigger than you usually would get."
My daughter was size 7 I ordered a size 9 they were still very tight. I'd say size up 10 they would fit perfectly. They super cute otherwise
"4 stars for sizing issue. Not true to size at all. They run very small. But after return and requesting 3 sizes bigger, we are pleased. The shoes are cute in person than in pic."
Honestly look way better in person does not look super cheap in the bowl detail is very decent
"real cute but ran small, loved the look but had to return"
To small for my granddaughter
Runs smaller than the actual size.
Very cute but they run small. Returned it.
Ordered a size 6. Looked like size 3. Was very small. Not very good quality.
They were extremely small not true to her size at all. Pretty but no good if it don’t fit.
"So comfortable. Soft white leather. True to size, authentic product."
"Amazing value, super soft leather and incredibly comfortable and lightweight!"
"Very poor leather quality. The sneakers are very cute and elegant but have been sitting in my closet for the past months. I don’t see myself wearing them again. I wore them for a couple of weeks and they got soiled, as all shoes do. When I tried to clean them with a damp cloth, which I always do with my soiled leather shoes, I got a discoloration as a result that was even bigger than the initial spot, and nothing can be done about it. It cannot be fixed. Unfortunately, a waste of money."
"Not leather, inside or out. Really smelly polyurethane smell, too. Got them for $23.00, so I'm keeping them. No wonder one of the reviewers stated that they didn't last."
"This shoe is a bit too tight and the leather shoelaces shed little pieces of leather! They did include a second pair of cotton laces, which is odd."
"Super cute shoes. The leather laces are just ridiculous because they shed everywhere, but they send regular laces to change them out."
"need to put in an insole that supports a foot I don't like wearing flat shoes so I put my own in. The top of the shoe rubbed really bad on my right foot large toe joint which is my ""good"" foot. My left foot with having had major surgeries didn't have same issue. So I am still healing from 2 bad blisters on the right toe joint a week ago."
"Great quality leather, narrow fit but length is true to size. They're in new condition but came in tissue in an amazon box, no frye box. the laces seem really long and thick for the shoes but overall they're super cute and a great way to dress up sneakers!"
"I bought these shoes despite the price tag of 140$ because they were exactly my style and when I got them I indeed loved the look, however, the first day I wore the shoes (only for 2 hours) I got a blister the size of a quarter (that have caused me to loose sleep for two days do to pain). If shoes are that pricy there is no reason why they shouldn't be built with comfort or at the very least not cause this amount of pain :("
"Great fit, but the sole is totally flat and hard, offering very little traction. Odd being able to accidentally slide while wearing a tennis shoe. Thick suede laces are not easy to use."
Sehr schöner Schuh zum günstigen Preis
"Diese Gummistiefel sind im Vergleich zu vielen anderen alternativ bestellten sehr bequem, nicht so eng geschnitten am Fuß, sie haben eine biegsame Sohle und sind vorallem geruchsarm.Kann ich nur weiterempfehlen!"
"Die Stiefel sind von ganz guter Qualität, sehen hübsch aus und sind wohl lt. meiner Tochter auch bequem"
Meine Tochter zieht sie gerne an. Sie fallen allerdings etwas kleiner aus.
"Überrascht, sind süße weiche Gummistiefel!"
Qualität ist gut und wie erwartetGerne empfehle ich weiter:-)
Meine Tochter liebt diese Gummistiefel. Preis-Leistungsverhältnis stimmt
Preis - Leistung in Ordnung.
Bardzo ładne i wygodne
Super Passform
Great shoes for kids. The pink is actually nicer in real life than photos.
"I bought these  June 15. The shoes are either defective or counterfeit, it’s now July 21. The return window closed 7 days agoand unfortunately these tennis shoes created a hole where my toe is. I wore them approximately one hour per day and not every day throughout the month. I’ve bought new balance, even this same style,  for years and never had this happen within the first month. They’re either defective in which case I’d like the manufacturer or seller to return them and replace with a new pair or they’re counterfeit and not made well. I’m hoping Amazon or the seller will get in touch with me so we can rectify the situation. Thank you"
"My son is flat-footed with an overpronation problem. These shoes have helped stabilize that. Plus, he is really rough on shoes, but these hold up ok. By the time he grows out of them, they are pretty demolished, but they last long enough for us."
These shoes wore out quickly. Fewer than 3 months and they have a big hole and the soles are separating from the shoe. We bought New Balance from the local NB store and they lasted 7 months. These were disappointing.
my kid has very wide feet so sizing is always difficult but these fit true to size in XW. I ordered 4 pairs NB (all in different models in xw) and by far he says these have the best cushioning and support. only wish they had more colors.
"I bought these for my 9yo in a size 7. I came on here and saw a great deal! I got these for $18! It had to be a mistake. My daughter loves them and says she never wants to take them off they are so comfortable. Mom, it feels like I’m walking on clouds!"
Just under (2)two months and both left and right soles have split apart! Will never purchase these models of NB. Never had any other issues with the other models. Buy at your own risk and NOT recommend these shoes for the kiddos.
"I purchased these for my daughter in June.  By the time school started in August they had holes in them.  Keep in mind my daughter was wearing flip flops most of the summer, not tennis shoes. These were not worth the money for less than two months of wear."
I bought a pair for daily walking and running (5.5 in big kid as I'm a size 7 in women).  I've yet to experience any pain in my feet. I needed a pair of shoes to support my flat feet and the these definitely do the job. The arches are wonderful on my feet and the shoes are light. They're breathable and super bright! I've gotten many compliments. I plan on purchasing another pair before they run out!
Good looking shoe. The previous pair we had of this same shoe lasted for almost a year on a boy who is really rough on shoes. Runs a little large. Great for kids who tend to walk on the insides of their feet. Nice color combination.
Very comfortable and perfect fit. I bought this colour because it was half the price of the other colour options and I wanted the shoe for outside work so colour was of less concern. I like the colour and am wearing these shoes much more than I expected to. Excellent value.
"I'm wearing them now.  There're very light BUT very strong!  I'm not quite sure about this, but I'm pretty sure that on a wet floor, they're more stable when I put weight on them.  I simply don't want to know WITHOUT A DOUBT, because I don't want to get my insurance involved. ;]"
Excellent
Very comfortable and the color is accurate
Love it I have nothing bad to say about it.
"Confy, expectrd size"
nice color
"These super cute, casual sneaker that are pretty comfy. I personally would prefer a bit more arch support, but they are still comfy for casual wear.  They look cute with shorts, jean, and casual dresses.  I love the little gold details, like eyelets and on the end of the shoe strings."
"These are easily the worst shoes I’ve ever owned. I love the print, but they are so uncomfortable. There is padding in the bottom and the back of the shoe, but the back of the shoe pinches my heel. I did buy gel inserts to put in the back of the shoe, and they don’t help. I was hoping that the problem would get better once they were broken in, but I’ve worn them almost daily for 2 weeks and it’s not. I will not be buying another pair of Keds."
These are so cute but I had to return them as they were way too stiff and would have caused blisters on my heels for sure. I had red marks just from trying them on. Super bummed because they are so cute.
I love these shoes. They are so comfortable!
Very cute!!
Beautiful and comfortable pair of shoes! I absolutely am obsessed with these!!
"Very cute but horribly uncomfortable and strange sizing. Narrow in toe area but long and stiff, rubs heel. Returning."
"I love Keds, they are one of my favorites shoes. I especially luv the cheetah print, that is also my favorite."
Perfect Fit ! Look Great! So Comfortable!
"Sind soweit zufrieden.Schuh ist einfach schick mit den Blümchen darauf und die Farben sowieso.Verarbeitung ist immer soweit in Ordnung, ist auch nicht unser erster Schuh dieser Marke.Punkt Abzug gibt es nur für die Größe, da wir etwas wollten das bissel länger hält und eigentlich ne Nummer größer genommen hatten, nur ist er schon bald wieder zu klein.Aber alles in allem kaufen wir gerne diese Schuhe, preiswert und gut."
"Acquistate in offerta a €10,50 il prodotto ha un ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo, sono ben rifinite, calzano bene, sono anatomiche e la bambina le trova comode. Le ho trovate migliori di altre marche più blasonate che di solito ""appiattiscono"" l'arco plantare, queste, invece, lo seguono molto bene."
Ich habe erneut Schuhe dieser Marke für meine Tochter für den Sportunterricht bestellt. Ihr gefallen sie sehr und sie sind sehr bequem. Eigentlich hat meine Tochter grad 30/31. Die letzten Schuh waren in 31 aber sind ihr jetzt zu klein. Habe die 32 u 33 bestellt... Man kann die Innensohle rausnehmen und da sieht man das die 33 genau richtig ist...Fazit: Lico immer 2 Nummern größer bestellen solange das Kind noch wächst 😉
Unsere Kinder tragen seit Jahren Sportschuhe von Lico und das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis hat uns immer überzeugt! Bei dem letzten Paar Löst sich leider nach kurzer Tragezeit die Fußsohle und ist nun zur stolperfalle geworden...:-(
Mit großen Augen hat meine Tochter (6) diese Schuhe bestaunt und gleich getragen. Passen perfekt und sind bequem. Und vor allem sehen sie super aus 😍
Very pretty in appearance but the soles come loose after just 2 months. I do not recommend this.
Wenn ihr sie bestellt empfehle ich 1-2 Nummern kleiner
"Muy buena, mi hija de 4 años las usa para la gimnasia del cole y después de un año de trote, aún están perfectas. Me ha gustado ésta marca, repetiré!"
Die Schuhe sind sehr schick.
En un par de meses las puntas de las zapatillas ya estaban despegadas y en unos meses más tienen un aspecto lamentable
These are great minus the fact the tongue is sewn to the insides of the shoe...maybe that is a thing they do to cleats but my first experience and makes a little difficult to get on but upside doesn’t come off easy either when untied. So otherwise 5star would have been given!
The opening for the shoe is fixed. It doesn’t stretch and the opening is small. So unless you have an extremely petit ankle and foot area then these are nearly impossible to put on.  My 9 year old who is petite couldn’t even get these on after trying a second pair a size larger.  Disheartening considering Adidas cleats are our normal go-to.
Daughter loved them. Fit was great and they look great too! Daughter is 12.
"Shoes fit perfect. You have to break them in though. Overall, great fit and great look."
No more blisters
I wear a size 9 1/2 fits perfect!
Too small. I want to return them for a pair that fit comfortably. Have two bloody blisters now.
"My wife recently used these every day on our cruise and found them to be excellent for dancing.  They are pretty good looking, too."
First pair I ordered was too large but these fit perfectly. I normally take a 11 1/2 but a 11 was too large. 10 fits nicely. They are very nice sandals at a very reasonable price.  Very fast shipping. I ordered them just before noon on Thursday and they arrived Friday.  WoW.
"After I tried them on, I then bought a different type, because the insole has a ridge on one side that feels uncomfortable.(The different ones I bought next — DenverHayes Quad Comfort — feel amazing!)"
"Yes, my husband was thrilled with his new Sandals! They fit very good and he was happy with the colour choice!"
Fue un regalo para mi papá y le quedaron muy bien. Cómodas y frescas
"Los pedí para mi novio, él es #7 en México y los que pedí de acuerdo a la conversión le quedaron un poco grandes pero nada grave. Me dice que son muy cómodos y se nota desde el material de la plantilla. Son bonitos y los compré a muy buen precio durante el hot sale."
Perfect. Exact size. Very comfortable. Would buy again.
As ordered. Wish someone would make them out of leather. Would have given 5 stars if had leather uppers.
The quality is not good
"A bit bigger.The foam will sunk in and your feet will feel the bottom.Due to a bit oversize when walking, the area near the toe cap is rubbing my toes."
"El producto es de una excelente calidad, es muy amblio y recuerden que si lo usan sin calcetin, recomiendo pedir una talla mas chica."
Purchased for myself but found too narrow for my feet. Gifted to my daughter whose feet are skinnier. LOLGreat price and nice looking sneakers :D
"Quedan perfecto a la talla, yo soy talla 5, pedí 8 USA y me quedó perfecto.Son suaves,  cómodos y originales,  los ame, son super livianos para correr!"
"Son muy ligeros, ideales para correr o en general hacer ejercicio. Aunque son sencillos, son muy cómodos y están lindos. Soy talla 25 MX, pedí el 8 de EEUU y me quedaron bien."
Según lo esperado para la marca parecen ser de excelente calidad. Falta ver desempeño a largo plazo.
Product wore out after 7 weeks of use on the sole and the upper mesh.  Just athletic long 10K walks 5 times a week.
Muy cómodos para hacer ejercicio y el outfit diario.
Fits perfect and looks great!
"Compro scarpe softinos da qualche anno, ormai… sono belle esteticamente, molto curate nei dettagli, e, cosa importantissima, ultracomode. Come guanti. E spesso riesco anche a trovare delle buone offerte. Ma queste… un disastro! Esattamente come è successo all'altro acquirente, la suola si è letteralmente staccata dalla tomaia. E non puoi nemmeno restituirle, perché le hai usate, ovvio. Spero che qualcuno, almeno, legga queste recensioni."
Merci
Ultraleichter und angenehmzu tragender Schuh. Leider löst sich schon beim 2. Tragen die Sohle ab. Qualität mangelhaft.
"SUPER COMODOS, QUEDAN COMO UN GUANTE, LA TALLA EXACTA, ME ENCANTARON."
"I read many reviews before I bought these. Since so many people said they run big and my last pair of adidas cloudfoam were pretty big, I went half a size down. I usually wear 8.5 so I ordered an 8. They were a little tight the first couple times I wore them so I would advise just ordering them in your regular size. Luckily they've stretched out a bit so my foot fits in there perfectly now. I just have to wear thin socks. The shoes are super light weight. I've used them for the gym and for running errands. Only thing I don't like is that the bottom of the shoe is too smooth. I'd be scared to wear these on a rainy day."
Al mes se dañoNo es buena calidad
Nice tough shoe for my play hard grandson to wear with his school uniform. He’s hard on shoes and these are holding up nicely.
Great shoes for school
Tolles Fußbett
Sehr schnelle Lieferung gute Verpackung des gewünschten Artikels.Gerne wieder
"Super bequemer Schuh, schöne farbe"
"I own this shoe in denim, burgundy, pink, mint green and now red. Love them all"
Shoe was started to tear ( see above) just in 5 outings on the court.This needs to be replaced
Nice shoes and good bottom support but way way too narrow and pinches my toes. I have small narrow childlike feet and these are still way too narrow! Not accurate sizing.
These shoes are very nice and quite comfortable. I usually wear a 10 but these fit small so I had to reorder in 10.5. Love skechers slip on shoes!
Holes have worn in the toe area within months of moderate indoor use. Very poor quality. I was happy with these shoes until this happened. See image. I'll NEVER buy Skechers again.
Love these shoes. Lightweight and very comfortable.  Not good for a wide foot. Otherwise true to size.
Perfect fitting...Very Light Weight and Comfortable... Highly recommend 👍🏻👍🏻
Way too small for a size 7
I’m happy with fit and comfort of shoe
"I love the way it fits, very comfortable for work."
severe foot pain near the ankle after wearing this shoes. It is surely a defective product. Window return closed so couldnt exchange. What a waste.!!
They seem a bit odd fitting compared to other sketchers but ok. Getting use to them.  The back is a bit low
La consueta sicurezza nell'acquistare scarpe Ecco. Comode e confortevoli.
"Loved the shoe - super comfortable. Only problem was the color - kid of a taupe-y grey.  Just a little off for my clothing colors.  Would have been great if it was a true dark charcoal grey - otherwise, straight black always works, but sadly, that was not a color option."
"Way to narrow, plus the upper was not flexible."
No era lo q esperaba. Me base en la tabla que tienen para las tallas y me quedo demasiado grande. La parte de enfrente estaba demasiado ancha también. Y el color no era como el de la foto.
"Dos veces pedí este modelo, en uno me cancelaron el pedido y el reembolso fue rápido. La segunda vez me mandaron el número equivocado, se le quedaron a un familiar,  el modelo le gustó y la comodidad, recomiendo que pidan medio número menos del que calzan vienen amplios."
"La calidad de los tenis es muy buena y a ese precio excelente! En lo particular me encanta el color, los uso para correr y son muy ligeros y cómodos."
"Los devolvi, el precio era atractivo pero no me gustaron los acabados y la forma, parecia tamal. Los colores no eran feos pero no eran de una calidad destacable. no pagaria mas de 500 pesos por ellos."
POR CONSEJO DE UNA  AMIGA PEDÍ TENIS DE ESTA MARCA. ELLA DIJO QUE VENÍAN EN TAMAÑO REDUCIDO. ASÍ QUE SOLICITÉ 2 NÚMEROS MAS  GRANDES. POR LO CUAL NO ME QUEDARON. TUVE QUE DEVOLVERLOS
"Somehow I think the shoes look wider on the pictures, colours are very true to the pictures, shoe soles are not as thick as I have imagined. But for the sales price I got I cannot really complain much."
"Los tenis están suuuper bien, un producto de calidad, sin embargo los devolví derivado a qué a la persona le quedaron demasiado grandes a pesar de ser su talla, es decir, vienen más grandes, MODO WIDE, para personas con pie ancho, OJO: si los vas a comprar ten en cuenta que vienen más grandes que la talla que compras."
"Excelente!! Me gustaron más como se ven ya puestos que en la imagen. Súper cómodos.Pedí 7 WiDE y con las plantillas que uso quedaron perfecto. Me encanta New Balance porque nunca he tenido que ""moldear los zapatos/tenis"" desde la primera ve se sienten muy agusto."
"Fueron los primero new balance de mi hija, me arrepentí de no haber comprado para mí ya que estaban con descuento, el calzado es cómodo, ligero y su estética esta del cien..... Volvería comprarlo"
"Me gustó el precio, estaba excelente, se sientes ligeros y muy cómodos, la parte del frente parece gamuza, pero no lo es, es un material sintético."
"New shoes specifically bought for thin soles used for drumming. Very comfortable. I always enjoy all of my Adidas shoes. Will only be used for drumming. Look great, more importantly appropriately thin-soled for drumming. Would recommend."
Very very good
weat 11 usually and for these shoes have 10.5 and next time i think ill go with 10. i'd say orear .5 smaller then your adidas shoes or 1 smaller then any other brand shoe. shoes are confy tho and seem durable
Awesome !!
Great shoe for the gym and skipping. I ordered half size bigger like recommended an they work perfect.  I wouldn't run in them but they are nice and flat and work great for squats and deadlift.
Good value for the money
Quality looks good however It was small in size. Return to vendor.
Great fit and feel would recommend this shoes
It is a really good pair of wrestling boots! I would recommend these for starters!
Great shoe but a bit narrow
Good shoes
Brought as a work boot but I did not like the height of the heel so returning for refund
"Good boot, just a little larger than expected as I ordered a little big thinking that actual size would be too small.... returned for a little smaller size."
Thank ya kindly sir
"This is my 2nd pair , love them , love them , love them. Be Blessed"
"I've been buying dan post albuquerque boots for several years now and they have been great until now. They have obviously changed the manufacturing to a much lower quality. I usually plan on buying a pair every year. I use my boots pretty hard in the garage for welding and fabricating and so far the albuquerque has taken the beating gracefully. But as soon as I opened the box for the new pair I immediately noticed the difference in quality. I included pictures of the old boot compared with the new one. The heal used to have layers of leather between the layers of sole material (rubber, plastic, poly-blablabla whatever?) It was tacked in to place and provided a sturdy support. The new boot has a chunk of foam like garbage the same as any pair of cheap garbage boot one could buy at Walmart. But they compensate for it by coloring it to look like layers of leather. I did try them on and they just didn't feel the same. The sturdy support I have come to count on has been replaced by a feeling of cheap low quality design compromises in exchange for quick profit. With a history of plantar fasciitus I just can't take the chance of wearing low quality footwear. Sorry Dan post, I gotta move on."
"I bought these with apprehension having Spine issues and a Spinal Implant Device for Pain. I have been a Wellington and Cowboy type Boot guy for Decades and had to stop wearing because of the high Heel causing lower Back Pain and thought I’d try the Dan Post due to the Reviews. I’ve always been a Justin Boot Guy with my first Justin Boots in 1987 but just sent back a pair after wearing them for 5 hours due to Pain and stitches popping on the  Left Boot, Justin has Issues now for some reason. I received my Dan Post today immediately put them on and WOW they are the most comfortable Cowboy Boot I’ve ever put on my Feet, I went to Walmart and walked for 2 hours and zero Back Pain from a non broken in Cowboy Boot, that’s unheard of and if you’re a Boot Person you know what I’m talking about, some discomfort is expected with new Boots. I have a flat kind of wide Foot and wear a 13 tennis shoe and I ordered the 12 EW because they were a lot cheaper and they fit just fine and in fact I could have worn an 11 1/2 and maybe had my Cobbler stretch them if needed. I’m so happy I snagged these Dan Post Boots and I’m just amazed at the Comfort Level from this type of Boot, I can’t imagine how Insanely Comfortable the Blayde or the Storm Tide would be with the extra cushion. I did have to put in an Insole due to my Right Boot missing one but it didn’t matter, these are just a quality Comfortable Boot.Semper Fidelis"
"These are comfortable and cushy in the foot. The toe box is narrow at first but you can use a cedar shoe tree to make room in the toes, to open the toe area for a better fit.  I wear a women's 8.5 and the men's size 7 fit well w/ an added 3/4 insert to fill up the space in the heels and add support. These would be great for winter, with the sturdy rubber soles with tread, and warm lining. But the heels were placed at an odd angle on these, so that I kept rocking back on the heels.  I put them on a table and saw the heels do not sit flush on a flat surface. This caused the front part of the heel to dig into the bottom of my foot when wearing, and I was constantly rocking back on the heels.I think this was a defect, so returned them. I read reviews that they now make these with a cheaper 'brushed or suede' type leather,  in the past they were made with a smooth leather, so the boots are no longer an ""oily brown"" as described, but more a reddish brown suede.  I noticed the boots suede leather wrinkled quickly just in trying them on, and I was not nuts about that. One way to fix that is to apply mink oil or red wing leather cream, and this smooths out the nap so they have a smooth leather finish and not suede. Boot manufacturers are swapping out this 'nappy brushed leather or suede' for real smooth leather on many boots, b/c it must be cheaper. Sad b/c the smooth leather looks better and wears longer."
I read a review before buying these where the guy noted that he had difficulty getting his heal down into the boot and as a result the fabric at he bottom of the shaft and the top of the heal cup tore.  Dan Post apparently fixed that problem buy adding a leather reenforcement. When I first put them on the left one went on fine but with the right one I had a good deal of difficulty getting my heal past the leather patch and into the heal cup.  It has gotten progressively worse until now I can not get the right one on no matter how hard I try.  Perhaps a boot horn would help but...anyway great boots if you can get them on. Very comfortable.  Not sure what to do at this point...So I contacted amazon and I am returning the original pair.  They sent out a new pair. This is an entirely different boot.  They are at least 1/2 too small.  MUCH narrower especially when viewed form the bottom. The sole is 1/2 narrower.  The Dan Post Tag is a different color (green and yellow as opposed to the black and gold of the original).  The heal seems higher.  Leather is inferior. Weird.  I called Dan Post and they said they are always making design changes.  Looks like I'm just going to get my money back.  Too bad.
"I've owned over 10 pairs of Dan Post boots. Yes, I'm a big fan of them. I enjoy wearing Western-styled clothes and boots. I'm also a truck driver, and a biker. These boots fit the bill for all of these. Right out of the box, they look great, and are very comfortable. I wear a 12D. I ordered a 12D, and the fit is spot on. No problems at the heel, arch, or toe. They're listed as Waterproof. Haven't put that to the test yet. They're not as heavy as I thought they'd be. Very nice boot, easy to get used to, and looks great. I gave them a good treatment of Leather Honey, to condition the leather, and give them some extra protection. All in all, a great boot. I have no issues with them. They're Dan Post boots---great boots, great quality, and great looks. As I titled this review, if you're considering these boots, buy them. A great all around boot. Lastly, I've read reviews, mentioning that they're made in China. Yes, unfortunately, mine say it, too. Really sad."
"I've owned these boots for two years and have worn them nearly every day.  From mud to motorcycles in the snow and rain, these boots have done all I've asked and more.  In fact they're still going and I can't stand not wear them because they're incredibly comfortable and just get better looking the more beat up they get.  I like them so much that I just bought a new pair to replace them only because the side seams and piping are starting to blow out and the sole of the heal is ready to hit leather.  I would have them resoled if it were not for the seam coming apart.I've given them 4 stars only because of the seam and piping but the fact that I bought another identical pair tells you that 4 stars is a great rating for me.The only time I don't wear these boots is when I'm working-out or I'm hiking.  Otherwise I wear them everywhere from business travel to working in the field.Pros:The fit is dead on at 9DComfort is excellentWaterproofing is excellentDurability is excellentLooks are excellentCon: The plastic piping and seams come apart before the rest of the boot is worn out. That's the only weak point and I think it's the piping that causes the failure."
Muy bonitos. Le gustaron mucho a mi hija. Vienen más grandes pero siempre compro una talla menos en esta marca. Los recomiendo
The shoes themselves are super cute but the box came trashed! I wouldn't say it was beat up during transit either. I was disappointed because they are a gift.
Cute shoes but started to stink with her not wearing socks after only a few wears. Very disappointed.
"leider viel zu groß, ging zurück, kulante Rückname, gute Abwicklung"
Ich trage Rolling Soft Schuhe von Gabor gerne und bin bis jetzt noch nie enttäuscht worden.
Schuhe passen wie erwartet 👍
Passen perfekt
Me ha gustado la rapidez de la entrega.
They look great on her feet. Really nice shoe. And has withstood the whole summer without looking so beat up. Lol
"These shoes fit my daughter as hoped, and they are SUPER cute. However, the zippers on the back are unbelievably hard to zip and unzip. I would much rather have bought her shoes that she can put on and take off without needing assistance."
"These sandals are adorable!! They fit just as expected. Probably not the best shoe for wider feet though as they’re pretty skinny, but work just fine for my step daughter. The back is a little hard to zip up and down but I’m sure it’ll be easier in time. Definitely would buy again."
"I bought these for my 4 year old. She absolutely loves them. She wears them every chance she gets and they dont show a lot of ""wear and tear."" They look great with shorts or a skirt/dress."
So fashionable. Well crafted.
My goodness do we struggle to zip these things up!They are much wider than anticipated.Meh
Cutest shoes ever! Exactly as described but cuter in person. They fit according to size!
"Came in a box from Kmart which was really nice, super cute, and well packaged. Has not tried them on yet but will love them!"
Lovely slipper..I accidentally ordered wrong size..I'm too far to return.
Great buy
"These shoes were packaged like they cost $100. Cans in a lovely reusable bag, a bracelet and a thank you card. Very nice. Highly recommended."
"Thought I would love these. I didn't open them right away, so I did a few days ago only to find that they fit about half a size big, and they feel like they're a wide width. Then I notice that the eyelets on the left shoe don't line up so when I tied it up it made it feel weird. I don't usually complain but the price of these was too much for what I received."
Excuse my fat ankles in the picture😁😬 But these are so very comfortable! And they are very lightweight too...not real heavy like some shoes are. I've been looking pretty much everywhere for a comfortable pair of shoes to do some walking in and these are just right. They're also easy to slip on without having to use your fingers to help with getting them on. I love them and may get another pair in a different color! 🎨
The shoe is stylish and comfortable. Please do not listen to previous review on sizing up.  I did and regret it. I wear size 8 ordered 8 1/2 and now a little too big.  Order your right size and you will be happy with this product.
The shoe is a bit narrower than I expected. They have good heel comfort but no arch support.
Love it comfortable and light weight buy them for work
They look great and feel good!
Muy cómodos y los números son exactos
Comfortable. Size was correct
Muy cómodo me gustan
"Ho acquistato queste scarpe perché catturato dal design moderno e accattivante.I materiali costruttivi sembrano abbastanza buoni, il mix tra pelle e tessuto stile camouflage sulla parte posteriore rende particolare la scarpa.Sono provviste di una zip laterale che permette di indossarle facilmente, la vestibilità è conforme alla solita taglia che indosso per altri modelli di scarpe e sono comode da calzare."
"Sieht gut aus, hält ohne Innenfutter auch warm genug und passt sehr gut.Material auch wie beschrieben.Würde fast behaupten er wäre eine Nummer zu groß bzw. passt meine normale Größe sehr bequem. Bei Sneakern nehme ich sonst immer eine Nr. größer, hier aber nicht erforderlich."
Verarbeitung und Qualität top. Modern und passen genau.
Bonitos y cómodos porque están anchos pero se despegaron muy pronto. Tenía mejores expectativas de esta marca y en esta ocasión no duraron.
"Bonito a la vista, pero de muy mala calidad, se despegaron al mes de uso, ambos tenis de toda la parte delantera, parecía una buena oferta, pero salí perdiendo"
Fue un regalo para una prima muy bonito a la vista por los colores esos colores morados le gustaron mucho y son comodos  me comenta.
Muy bonitos lastima que llegaron súper grandes en realidad no son 23 cm
"Están precioosos, aunque son tenis idealmente para niños, se los regale a mi hermana de 34 años y le quedaron a la perfección.  Estoy muy contento con la compra."
"me gustan los tens para mi hij, gracias"
Bonitos. De muy buena calidad.
Hermosos en verdad
Bien. Número exacto
Me gustó bien sellado original
"They sent the wrong size, product description was misleading"
"Buenos, un poco pequeños"
Like the shoes...received within 2 days...
"I have worn New Balance shoes for 10+ years now.  I started with New Balance WX1011 and WX1012 Cross trainers for tennis based on recommendation from my local New Balance specialty shop.  WX 1011 and 1012 were light weight mesh, flexible with good lateral support and soles that were not too stiff.  As a replacement shoe, New Balance recommended this 966v3 shoe. This is one of the most uncomfortable shoes I have tried on.  It is stiff, it presses across the toes and causes pain and the soles are too thick and stiff for quick movement on the tennis court."
"Comfortable fit except for the area at the top lace hole. It is very stiff and rests on the inner ankle bone which causes rubbing and discomfort. Tried tieing at a lower hole but still rubs. Once I figure out how to alleviate this problem I will be happy. Hope in time, it will loosen up."
"As mentioned by others, these shoes not only run small but they pinch in the forefoot. Also, the ""fit and finish"" of these shoes is highly disappointing -  the way the tongue is sewn into the shoe leaves a lot to be desired and the extra fabric inside the shoe rubs your feet. Finally, the plastic edge where the lace holes sit is extremely rigid and this same plastic edge also affects the front of your foot when tied.Am definitely returning and looking for a better solution."
"These are very uncomfortable sneakers.  I bought them a while  ago and thought they just needed more time to break in.  Months later, still feel stiff, heavy, and has some plastic pieces that dig in some spots.  Will have to get rid of these."
I loved the colors but sizing runs small. I wear a size 11 normally and was trying to find a wider pair of shoes. These are very tight on my foot and I’m hoping they stretch out a bit when worn in.
"When I ordered these, the website said 6.5 Medium but at checkout it said 6.5 D. I called Amazon & they said these were 6.5 Medium. They arrived & the box said 6.5 D. That’s too wide for me so I returned them. I have other New Balance tennis shoes that are 6.5B. I’m grateful shipping & return were free. Nice looking shoe."
Still battle with fit. Also the black is glittering which looks strange. NO arch support
"it is not original product, Replica of New Balance shoe..I really wonder and so very about India, why this much cheating and corruption happening India.I can see some places of shoe no stitches. Some place of shoe not sticked with glue very very very pooor product."
"New balance is a recognized brand for sports shoes, this particular shoe is branded as running shoes. I had purchased this shoe in 18 Dec 2020 & I am not able to use it anymore, due to the damage to the heel area. Within 2 months of use the area near my toe got damaged & I had to get leather patch glued to it (from inside) to prevent further damage (clearly visible on both shoes).Within 4 months heel support area got worn out (refer picture) causing pain in heel.For the price, this shoe should have lasted 2 years, but it did not last 4 months.I run / walk average of 5 to 8 km daily, normally my shoes last over 5 years, but I was expecting this shoe to last at least 2 years."
The got this shoe for just 1100 however the quality was not very good and fitting was also very tight. The inside sole and upper of shoe doesn't feel to be of high quality and looks like it won't last longer than 3-4 months. After seeing the shoe i returned it and would not recommend you to buy this particular shoe from New Balance.
"You get what u pay for. Decent for the price. Very basic shoe. If you want a neutral shoe which u can use for commute as sneaker and use it for ocassional short distance run then it might suit u. Cushioning is provided by fresh foam which is decent but not as plush. Not much of a tech goes into it. Like it doesn't have hard plate in mid sole which keeps ur midfoot stable or say solid heel lock is missing. No extra layers of protection, in terms of cushioning in the sole. Laces are just basic. Build quality is ok but not great. Not suitable for broad feet. Decent but I think Asics Gel Nimbus and Mizuno Waverider are miles ahead of it in terms of neutral road running shoe. Waverider 19 is still the most value for money product here in India. Gel Nimbus are bit expensive. If u still wanna stuck with NB better look for Fresh Foam 1080 V or 880 V."
"Fitting is perfect (i have ordered one size up). Light weight but the sole and quality of the product is good. Thanks amazon for the surprising offer, i am glad that i got this pair at a comparatively low price for this quality product.best for walking and running, it looks very stylish, we can use them as the casual wear too. After all it is NB it would fit for any duty.."
Initially..I was fooled by description that product need to be bought one size larger...But eventually 9 UK is 9.5 US so..Buy ur own size..Ran 5 km with it on first day..Comfortable..1000 skipping in one go..Comfortable..Only one test left..HOW LONG IT LAST..??Good product.
"estan hermosos y la gamusa es muy suave y se ven increibles, muy muy comodos y color y precio excelente. lo malo es que con el paso del tiempo se ensucian mucho, hay que tener cuidado con este tipo de tenis"
Vender un zapato tamaño wide sin aclararlo me parece un engaño. Era para deshacerse de sus saldos? Mínimo ofrezcan un precio acorde en todo caso.El tenis sería excelente si su tamaño fuese normal.
"Got these in 12, 4E as I have large feet. Usually, new balance fits me properly in 6E, but I thought I would give these a try to see. Man, these are made SMALL. Another pair of New Balance which I bought at the same time fit decently, these would not even get on my foot."
"Padrisimos y muy cómodoPara correr, soy más rápidoCon estos tenis, los siento muy ligeros y en carreras de 5 a 10 km me funcionan muy bien"
"Sehr schöner brauner Sneaker. Passt sehr gut und sieht nicht zu groß aus. Kann den Schuh nur weiter empfehlen, sieht sogar in echt besser aus die Farbe als auf jedem Foto. Würde ich wieder kaufen. Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis ist TOP!!!"
"Ganz schick,weich und bequem. Easy anzuziehen durch den seitlichen Reißverschluss. Guter Preis."

"Son unos tenis muy bonitos tuve que compramos de nuevo en una tienda por qué no me llegaron los que yo pedí y tuve que devolverlos y decidí buscarlos en una tienda Adidas y al probármelos me di cuanta que estaban muy duros no sentí al boots como le mencionan que son muy cómodos en verdad pagar más de 2,000 pesos por unos tenis con poco confort no vale la pena solo te venden la vista de unos tenis pero no los recomiendo"
Muy cómodos. Excelente compra. De lo mejor que he tenido adidasA considerar que siendo de tela se ensucian muy rapido y no es fácil limpiarlos
"Great solid shoe. Tight around the heel/Achilles initially, but gets better after some wear."
I have a very high arch and the shoes take the pressure and pain away when I play tennis. This is my second pair in two years and I love them
They were way too thin on my feet
"Maybe it’s just this color way but the fit is TERRIBLE. It’s tight mid-foot because of some band on the top but it’s actually loose in the toe box. When shoes fit this bad, I just can not recommend them for anything. Not for basketball, not for working out, not even for walking. Adidas is a great brand but they made a mistake with these shoes. I can only see them working if you have overly narrow feet and you size down them."
"First, these are good looking shoes, they fit pretty well, and the sole has pretty good grip.  What is extremely disappointing is the cushioning level.  What you see on the side of the shoe is not at all what is actually in the sole cushion.  I was looking forward to the Boost cushioning.  Instead, what you get appears to be less than a 1/4 inch of cushioning.  After playing a few games on a hard court, my knees were extremely sore.  All the cushioning you see around the heel is window dressing.  I would not recommend to anyone who values their joints."
"These shoes are awesome and are my new favorites. The Adidas ""boost"" on these are the best cushion I've ever felt to date. They feel really good when walking or running because you can feel the energy returned to your feet from the boost cushion. I want these shoes in a couple of different color-ways and the 3/4 or high top versions. I like the various different textiles/textures. The thick collar around the ankle & achilles looks kinda weird, but I'm used to it & like it now. Kudos to the design team, I would love to see how this shoe was made & put together. 👍🏾👍🏾😎✌🏿"
I have worn a 10 D my whole life. These shoes were so narrow I could not get my feet in them. Unless you have a narrow foot I would advise against them
gots no soul...grip too slick on indoor courts after only 4-5 wears.  The cushioning is pretty decent but shoes are worthless due to the slickness.  Adidas support was no help other than to suggest giving to a friend. I'm offering it to my enemies instead.  Going back to Nike.
"Son super cómodos y bonitos, no vienen amplios asi que pidan pantalla correcta en mi caso fue 23 y medio, y me quedaron muy bien, los colores son muy bonitos y variados, excelente producto 👍"
"Llegaron un día antes y todo bien, la talla es la habitual, todo muy bien"
"Bonne grandeur , bien emballé dans la boîte et super confortables"

Me encantó!!!
"Sehr schöner Schuh in einem schicken altrosa! Passt perfekt, meine Tochter findet ihn super bequem, gibt nichts zu meckern!"
Im Lockdown sehr schnelle Lieferung.Tochter sehr glücklich.
Tengo varios modelos de Chuck Taylor estás son con diferencia las mejores.Se nota la calidad y los materiales en su fabricación.
"El producto presenta algunos pequeños problemas de acabado parece que son rebajados a 59.95 por esos detalles, es un producto de 89 dólares, el envió llego tarde, la vez pasada compré unos Converse del mismo modelo pero en amarillo en la misma tienda y la compra fue perfecta el envió  llego muy rápido y los zapatos impecables. Por lo tanto parecen ser rebajados por algún detalle, así y todo los converse color burganty son bellos ."
This was a gift but was to large for the recipient
This was a gift and the recipient loved it
"Un espectáculo, de los mejores mandriles, súper recomendados ."
<3
"Calzata comodissima, il piede sta comodamente nella scarpa che si calza facilmente. Il plantare è comodo quindi va bene anche per chi ha la pianta un po’ larga. Dall’immagine non sembrava evidente che i filetti più chiari sono argento. Ho deciso di tenerla per la comodità utilizzandola anche con un outfit più serale."
"Super Schuhe - sehr edel. Stoff ist mit silbernen Glitzer, kann man auf dem Foto kaum erkennen. Schnelle Lieferung, jederzeit wieder. 👍 👍"
😉😉😉😉
Sizes run a little big so I might suggest going half size smaller than your usual but the shoes are so cute I love them
A bit wide but classy look
"they are really comfortable, great to run and lift in. a little loose but they fit length wise."
"Excelente calidad, son muy comodos el unico punto que pudiece decir en contra es la medida es ligeramente mas justa, yo calso del 29 cm y estos tenis son lieramente mas ajustados, pero creo que es el estandar que usa la marca, tengo otros puma de la misma medida(otro modelo) que compre en  liverpool y el mismo detalle observe. Tal vez conviene pedor medio numero mas para personas con los pies mas gorditos."
Perfectly as expected & resquested. Asé.
Son chingones los zapatos
"Me encantaron, llegaron un poco tarde pero llegar, amplios y con suela blandita"
Los zapatos de peor calidad que he tenido en mi vida. Después de 2 semanas comienzan a desmoronarse
"Llegaron a tiempo, la plantilla es muy cómoda, son bonitos."
La suela está muy delgada se siente toda las piedras
"Buen producto, y llegó super rápido"
"Excelente producto,llegó antes de lo previsto y es económico."

Super passend-schöner Sneaker für Frauen.
"Los tenis son preciosos y muy cómodos, son de buen material, la calidad se nota, los pedí medio número más grande de lo que soy, mi medida es de 24 cm y 6 US, así que los pedí de 24.5cm y de 6.5 US, porque leí en otros comentarios donde mencionaban que venían algo reducidos, y me quedaron muy bien haciendo esto."
"están geniales, y muy buena calidad pero si tiene algo pequeña, usable y espero que se estiren un poco con el uso."
Shoes are really nice however size chart seems to be incorrect so have to return my son is disappointed as these were for back to school
"Los tenis son de una calidad impecable, muy cómodos, el interior es un cojín muy suave y en apariencia se ven muy bien"
"Simplemete: hermosos. Los materiales, la comodidad, en fin, costo beneficio sobrepasa las espectativas. Sin problema listo para comprar otra variante."
Muy bonitos tienen los colores muy vivos en las líneas tal y como se muestra. Para mi que calzo de 12 US o 30 mx me quedaron un poco ajustados.
Siempre voy sobre seguro con Puma. El calzado es cómodo y muy bonito
Ordered this and the Rebound. Both ordered 1 size bigger. The Rebound fits but the Backcourt is slightly narrow. Break in requires about a week. Quite comfortable.
"Muy bonitos,  son muuuuyyyy comodos, son geniales."
"El color en vivo es maravilloso, la comodidad es muy buena. Me quedaron a la medida."
"Quedan muy chulos. Son de cuero y tela. Van cosidos a la suela además de ir pegados, para más refuerzo. Son algo estrechos por la zona de los dedos y empeine, para pies más gorditos no irían bien. Encantada con la compra"
"Etwas größer als erwartet, behalte sie dennoch für demnächst. Tolle Qualität, wie immer bei Bisgaard."
"Sehr schöne Schuhe in bekannter Bisgaard Qualität. Waren sofort der neue Lieblingsschuh beim Kind. Durch den Klettverschluss können die kleinen sie auch selbst an- und ausziehen, perfekt."
"Les chaussures sont très chouettes et taillent comme prévu. J’avais déjà acheté cette marque.Par contre je déplore la mauvaise qualité du cuir, qui est râpé dès la première occasion (et elles ne manquent pas avec notre fils de 6 ans). Les semelles en cuir à l’intérieur se sont décollées au niveau du gros doigt de pied et celui-ci est très marqué.Bref vraiment la qualité n’est pas au rendez-vous"
Muy cómodos
"Ok, so normally New Balance shoes run a little small. My normal running shoes are Asics Gel Kayano 11.5 4E width. That is my absolute standard when it comes to fit and feel.When I usually purchase New Balance shoes, I get size 12 4E. Even then, its can be slightly short, but tolerable.  With these shoes, I started with the 12 4E. But man do they run long. The width seemed to be pretty accurate though.So I went with the 11.5 4E instead. They fit almost perfectly, except MAYBE a little long in the toes. However, I believe it were a size down, it would be a little too short.These are absolutely awesome on outdoor pickleball courts. I've easily put on about 20 hours of play on them, and they barely have any wear. I HIGHLY recommend and love them so much, I actually have a 2nd pair as backup."
"New Balance shoes are the only shoes I wear.  I own about 15 pair.  Always 8 1/2 to 9D.  This is much narrower than all my other shoes, right about where the arch is.  New Balance really screwed up here.  Long time buyers used to be able to find the newer model of a pair of shoes that they like but not any more.  I wish somebody at New Balance would listen to their customers."
"I wore 1004 4e, 1005 4e. Once NB made the 1006 the toe width got narrow. I figured I’d try these and they were comfortable for a 3 hour match. I don’t know how durable they will be but for now they were worth the money. I’m editing because after 6 weeks these shoes are not durable."
"I play ALOT of pickleball and platform tennis. Both are tough on shoes. Time will tell about the durability. But from a fit, weight, and mobility standpoint,  these IMO are best in class. I've tried several major brands and the umpteen different models they offer. I even tried other New Balance models. All we're either too rigid, too loose, heavy, etc. Thank goodness for amazons return policy. Not mentioned, they look good too!"
"Attractive style but too narrow and low for my wide, high instep, hammer toed feet. They killed my hammer toe. New Balance is my go to for racquetball and walking sneakers but these are narrower and lower at the toe than the 608s I uaually wear. Should have returned but kept past the return limit trying to break them in. My bad"
These tennis shoes are working very well. It gives me the advantage I was looking for.
"I purchased these sneakers in late July.  I have worn them a hand full of times and noted a very foul odor after each use.  I have always played sports and have never had this problem with any other court shoes in the past.  Because I have gone over the return window, I am forced to throw these shoes away and buy a different pair.  I am so disappointed. I paid over $84.00 for these sneakers."
"So far so good. I’ve only played on them a few times but the fit is good, the cushioning is good and they look great."
Feel apart in less than a month of play.
Einfache Halleschuche gute preis  gute Leistung  aber form ein bisschen klein bestellen sie 1 Nummer grosse
Katastrophe.
Pumas come small and narrow but overall design appears good.
I don't recommend first day
"After measuring my foot, following the size chart and ordering a 7, I could barely fit my foot in the shoe. Turns out I have an incredibly high instep, so I went a full size up to the 8. Fit like a glove! The arch support was in just the right spot - I've NEVER felt so supported by any boot before, hiking or otherwise. There is comfortable padding on the ankle, so no worry abt clipping a rock and having it knock your bone. Also the weight of these boots is incredible. SO LIGHT!!! I feel like I'm wearing sneakers.The other day I took them for a ""test walk"" through a local stream, and while I stayed mostly on the sandy/muddy bank, I did occasionally walk through the water to see how the waterproofness held up. EXCELLENT! I could feel the coolness of the water but my socks stayed 100% dry.I've gotten lots of compliments already and they are by far the coolest looking hiking boots I've owned. I love that the design is not TOO overly ""outdoorsy"" looking and doesn't have a lot of extra straps in the design (ie. keen or LL Bean  boots).Buy these boots and you won't be sorry!!"
"Don’t waste your time with these.  So I bought the boots in October of 2019.  Yes they are very comfortable and light, but my boots tore right  where the black part of the bottom seams to the shoe. It’s the area where the foot would flex as you step.  I contacted Vasque Red Wing and they told me they offer a 12 month warranty on any manufacturer defects. Sounds great! They told me they have a defect contract with Amazon to take care of this.  So I then reach out to amazon and they tell me that I’m past my 30 days and that they would pro rate me part of the refund and I would keep the boots and get them fixed myself. Sounds great, but that didn’t happen either, they send me a return label and will refund me 80% of the boot value because it’s considered a late return.  Failure from both companies. The 12 month warranty means nothing from Vasque and Amazon did nothing to help. My suggestion is to buy directly from a retailer. Then you may have a chance with the boot warranty.  It’s a tough pill to swallow for 4 month old boots that are $100+.Update:1/30/2020-  apparently Vasque is having issues with Amazon honoring their 12month defect contract.  Once I got this through for Vasque to understand, they offered me a replacement pair of boots, making good with their warranty.  It was a fight, but I am getting new boots from the manufacturer."
"Just received bought the eggplant I love this show. Not hiked in it yet though. It has a high arch support, and a padded super comfy heap. So for people with heal pain great shoe. My normal size is 8.5, I ordered a 9 based on reviews that it runs small. Well I now need a 9.5 so asking seller if they will exchange. This is not a shoe for a wide footed person but if you are a regular Vasque purchaser you will know that. I would have given 5 stars but for the hassle of having to exchange and hope I don’t get charged extra because shoe runs small!"
"I am a full time vegetable farmer and my shoes have to go through some serious work throughout the season! For the past three months I’ve had these boots and I’ve really loved them. They’ve got a nice tread that I’m kept quite stable walking on rough terrain all day, but they don’t cake quite so heavily with mud when I am working in wet soil.Like any boot that isn’t a rubber rain boot, they will get moist in the inside if I’m really soaking them in puddles and such, but on wet mornings they stay quite dry when I’m walking through dewy grass. I still usually wear Muck boots in those conditions though.The best thing about these boots is their weight and flexibility. My feet and legs really enjoy the sneaker-like feel to these and I can wear them all day and not feel like I’ve got lead weights on my feet. Additionally, they’ve been super easy to hose off at the end of the day.Finally, I’ve been working in 90+ degree days in these and when I’m wearing my summer weight socks, I’m not get boiling hot feet. So that’s a huge plus.Just remember to size up! I was worried that even when I sized up they were a little snug around the edges of my feet (my feet are a relatively normal width, maybe a tiny bit wide), but after even a day of wearing them, they stretched out some and are my favorite farming boot to date!For reference, I typically am walking 3-5 miles a day on the farm and doing lots of bending and crouching. I have yet to see indications of wear at the crease points near the base of my toes from crouching, which is always the first place to “go” in my work boots.So far, they’ve been worth the investment! We will see in a few months how they actually hold up to eastern PA farming."
"I want to love these shoes, but there's one MAJOR flaw with the design of these shoes witch make these a dealbreaker for me. I've been hiking for years, and I know from experience this design flaw puts you at higher risk for a sprained or broken ankle.  The tread on the sole around the back outside of the shoe does not extend to the edge, which means, when you lean your anke to the side, there is a point at which the shoe will buckle for lack of support, and you're going down! All that time an money for product development, I'm surprised that this got overlooked. It's a bummer, because these would otherwise be great shoes! If you want an expensive pair of comfortable rugged shoes for walking on flat surfaces, then these would be fine."
"The first thing to get out of the way with these unusual but incredibly awesome hiking boots is the fit...they literally fit like a glove - snug, and almost unsettling close to the actual shape of my foot.  At first I found them to be too small, that is until I realized they just fit closer to my foot’s natural shape than normal shoes do.  If you’re used to the way American work boots fit (extremely large) you may find these “too small”.  They have a deep heal cup, pretty high arch support, and a slightly more square toe box than normal shoes.  The soles have fantastic grip on rocks, and are pretty much the best combination of cushion without being too vague or soft that I have found in a shoe.  I also like that the sole isn’t overly wedged forward like a running shoe, it gives these boots a really planted feeling in rough terrain.  In fact, after wearing these boots for a couple consecutive long off-trail hikes and then switching to a more normal running shoe, I found it surprisingly difficult to keep my footing in the running shoes, which made me realize how great these boots are at keeping my feet stable.  The lacing system is pretty normal, nothing funky, but I will say that the all black and two military looking colors seem to be the only 3 versions with captive upper eyelets instead of hooks - in my opinion the hooks can be dangerous if not lethal by accidentally snagging the laces from the opposite shoe (giving a momentary “feet tied together type fall)...this is especially dangerous if you plan to be climbing around rocks or in areas where a fall could be disastrous/deadly.I like these boots so much I’m buying a second pair incase they’re discontinued."
"I have been using Vasque boots for over 20 years with great satisfaction.  Specially the Breeze series that is an exceptional combination between comfort, support and lightweight for hiking in hot weather.These shoes are exceptionally light but offer almost no support.  They are fresh foam based and overly flexible.  I am very disappointed and recommend not buying this product even to walk in the city, let alone for a trail..."
"I read the reviews about the tightness. I don't have wide feet. I wear thick socks too. I went a 1/2 size up like you should on hiking boots. They did seem snug at first but I wore around the house and decided to give them a try. I'm so glad I did. I either got used to them or they did seem to break without discomfort. That first time I realized I could run in them too!. I use these to run on hiking trails and my feet and legs don't get tired. I love these boots/trail runners. FYI, they have a 6mm heel to toe drop."
"They are cute and very nicely made, but I can't get comfortable in them."
"I’m a plain clothes police officer and I was looking for comfortable, good looking, daily wear all weather boots. I purchased these to try them out hoping they’d work out. The first day I wore them, I spent 5 hours on my feet at the range  wearing a gun belt and armor, in wet grass and the temperature was around 40 deg F. They were perfect...I couldn’t believe how good they get over the course of the training. I then wore them another 8 or so hours afterwards both during and after work. Overall, these boots are incredibly light, very good arch support, excellent traction, adequate in keeping feet warm during cool temps and all around cushioned enough to be incredibly comfortable during just about any activity. i don’t have any experience with these types of boots, mine is limited to those of the tactical boot variety such as the Adidas GsG9 (original), Blackhawk, Oakley, Viktos, Nike (FSB), and my last were Solomon. These blow them all away in the comfort department, though I know they’re not very comparable. My only advice is I run between an 8.5 and a 9, I bought 9’s, which fit me perfectly but that leads me to believe these run just a tad small. The difference may be negligible to most, but figured I’d mention it. I love wearing these and didn’t realize there were boots out there quite this comfortable.*UPDATE*2 months in of almost daily wear, multiple outdoor range dates, 4 days straight of outdoor training at 8 hrs per day on my feet. These boots are absolutely outstanding, so comfortable, supportive and waterproof...my only gripe is the treads are so good that it’s a little hard to get the mud and grass out of them afterwards..."
I ordered this shoe for my daughter and it was true to size.  She loved it.  The order was shipped in a timely manner and the price was reasonable.
"I love these hikers! They are extremely comfortable. I received them the day before my hiking trip and wore them to break them in, they were perfect. I wore them for about nine hours the next day and never felt more comfort. They were comfortable around foot, gave a little bounce back when I walked and great ankle support. I will say if you have a wider foot, this is not for you. I have a narrow to medium foot and at first was afraid of the snugness, but I was able to wear a thick hiking sock and it was fine. I would highly recommend these and will be purchasing more."
"Perfect fit, great price, happy daughter! I am now making up words to satisfy the minimum word count that is ridiculous."
I got these shoes for my daughter who plays volleyball. Great purchase. She loves them. They are comfortable and really excels her game.
Great shoes at a great price. Were delivered earlier than expected - which is always a good thing! Amazon is the way to go!
"Ho acquistato queste scarpe per utilizzarle in palestra, principalmente per step e allenamento funzionale. Svolgono egregiamente la loro funzione: hanno un buon grip,  sono carine, sono leggere, non molto traspiranti a mio parere, hanno l'aria abbastanza sintetica, ma per il prezzo pagato sono un'ottima alternativa. Le sconsiglio tuttavia a chi ha la pianta larga: sostengono il piede, con un elastico interno, che permetterebbe quasi di evitare di allacciarle, ma inizialmente stringe. Ormai le sto usando da un mese e sono portabili, ma all'inizio ho avuto paura di aver sbagliato numero, nonostante alla prima prova mi fossero sembrate giuste. Purtroppo la differenza si sente indossandole per un pò di tempo: ad oggi, renderei un mezzo numero in più."
"Las zapatillas están bien por el precio que pague ,la parte de delante hace una forma redondeada un poco extraña ,no las he estrenado en principio tienen pinta de ser cómodas."
Fit is snugger than I was expecting (tongue connected to the interior sole by elastic) so I notice it as I have a high arch.  One shoelace arrived with the end ripped off and frayed (missing piece not in box) making it too short and preventing me from lacing in the eyelets.
Muy grandes
Ottima calzata. Consiglio di prendere una taglia più grande perché vestono piccolo. Sono confortevoli e adatte soprattutto a chi fa crossfit.
Muy contenta con este producto. Buen resultado y muy cómodas para practicar CrossFit
Son muy cómodas y sujetan muy bien el pie. Las recomiendo.
"Son muy cómodas, se ajustan bien al pie, el color es algo más llamativo que en la foto.Son ideales para work out , sin duda las recomiendo."
Son muy cómodas muy buena compra
Son falsas
"Chaussures très jolies mais qui ne durent pas. Au prix qu’elles coûtent dans les boutiques ou sur le net, c’est honteux. Je ne rachèterai plus jamais de chaussures de cette marque, je suis trop déçue par la qualité."
Belle chaussure mais se déchire facilement sur le dessus
Très déçus Mauvaise qualité Le tissus se déchire à la pliure du pied déçu sinon jolie chaussure jolie couleur noir paillettes
Las compré para mi madre y está encantada. En cuanto a diseño bastante bonitas y discretas y muy comodas.
"A unos 80€ que la pude comprar es sencillamente espectacular, no se puede pedir más. Básicamente son unas zapatillas trail running máxima amortiguación para tener la posibilidad de largos trayectos tipo ultra.Son excelentes en casi todo quizás los cordones son algo delgados pero puedes mejorar esto."
"Diese Schuhe sind einfach nur ""top""!!!Total schön von der Form, recht aufwendig und gut verarbeitet.Beinahe zu schade, sie zu tragen.Ich bin begeistert..."
Las zapatillas más cómodas que he tenido. Si necesitas amortiguación estas son una gran opción.La pena es que si las utilizas en asfalto se desgasta rápidamente la suela.El resto de la zapatilla está impecable
"Der Schuh fällt klein aus, normalerweise trage ich 45 bis 45 1/3 aber bei diesem Schuh sind es tatsächlich 46 2/3.Der Schuh ist leicht und hat eine weiche Sohle die beim Laufen schön dämpft"
Son preciosas pero mejor pedir mínimo 1 número más... Las he tenido que devolver ☹️
Ottimo prodotto acquistate anche in un'altra colorazione.
"Scarpe molto belle e comode, forse un po' calde in estate"
Son muy cómodas además de ligeras
Habe dann gerade die letzten beiden PAARE in meiner Größe auch noch bestellt;-)
Buenas zapatillas para caminos y/o pistas de tierra o piedra suelta
"El color me gustó mucho, es más rosa que como se ve en la foto, sólo no le doy 5 estrellas porque el acabado de la gamuza es mucho menos liso en un tenis que en el otro, pero ya puestos no se nota. Al principio se sentían algo pesados por la plataforma pero están muy padres y cómodos al caminar."
Buen Díaestán padrisimos los tenis pero la verdad no se si de casualidad manejan una talla mas pequeña es que si me queda casi un numero grandeojala pudieran contestarmegracias
"I got the olive green, great fit (with a half size down, my usual size). Great sole, great grip and very firm on the feet. Not loose at all. I am happy with the purchase."
Loving these too much!
"I usually wear a Women’s size 7, but I got a 6.5 and they fit perfect. I have these in white size 7 and they run a little large. I would size down half a size. Super cute and comfortable!"
"These are the most ill-fitting Pumas ive ever had. And the laces are more like ribbons than actually shoelaces. I have wider feet but that was never a problem with any other Pumas i've had. I had just got some similar orange platform ones and they were the best ever, these were the worst. Way too tight. i thought it was just me at first but then i didnt wear them for a while, and nothing else hurt my feet. Then i just thought i'd need to break them in, but i walked 10 painful miles at least in them over the past two months and my feet still hurt from wearing them two days ago. Nice color but shitty laces and too narrow."
Firstly the package when getting these shoes  is phenomenal. IT is a box within another box. Very secure. Open feeling the shoes you notice it's great quality. You can feel the laces are a step up from regular laces. I usually wear 9 but got a 9 1/2 due to shoes being a little narrow due to passed experiences. But the shoe fits to perfection and I got black to use more often . I absolutely love them ! Super nice and the platform helps with confidence and it's slightly curved but it works well for back.
"Don’t know how to say, can’t tell it’s true or fake product , that’s why gave 4 stars, but it’s heavier than regular sneakers, it makes you look cool whatever style you are in, and color is way light than in the display picture, overall just wearing a regular branded sneaker which don’t know true or fake."
"These shoes are adorable and the touches like the suede and ribbon laces make them stand out without being obnoxious. But the platform is made of concrete, I think? At least, it feels like I'm walking with bricks on my feet. There's no flex at all and zero cushion. I'd say buy a size up and put an insert in, but they run kind of big, and even an insert wouldn't make up for the fact that the shoes will not allow your foot to bend at all."
"I gave these shoes a three star because they are stylish and fit. However they are extremely uncomfortable to walk in. The built in insole feels like its designed to make your feet hurt. It would be fine If you could remove the insole it comes with but not only is it sewn in, its glued in as well, so to try and take it out your self would ruin the shoe. if you really want the shoe. Buy a size up and put a thick insole in and that will solve the problem. If you don't feel like going through that don't get the shoe."
"I love Geox shoes and I always buy size 10.5 which fit perfectly. This time I ordered my usual Geox size, but the shoes were too narrow. I returned them and ordered size 11 and they fit nicely. I bought them in the  blue colour which is darker than the pictures, more dark navy. Very elegant"
"Sehr schöner bequemer Schuh.Anziehen und loslaufen. Auch für komplizierte Füße gut geeignet.Die Farbe hellgrün erscheint mir mit einem Touch hellblau.Passt sowohl zu hellen Hosen, wie auch sehr gut zu Jeans.Ich habe sie schon mit und ohne Strümpfe getragen.Keine Probleme, von Fussgeruch keine Spur.Eben typisch Geox gut."
Avevo già provato questa marca quindi ho acquistato il numero a colpo sicuro. Ricevuto esattamente quello che mi aspettavo.
"Leider nur für schmale Füße, ansonsten ein sehr schöner Schuh."
"Sono belle ma, purtroppo, troppo stretto il solito numero che acquisto per le scarpe Geox (tenendo conto che le metto con i calzini). Sono dovuta passare al numero più grande."
"Very nice shoes, good fit, but litlle bit narrow"
Prese come regalo. Chi l'ha ricevute apprezza eleganza e traspirabilità che è la qualità di ogni Geox. Prezzo interessante.
tolle Schuhe
Good shoes but a little bit small.
Toller angenehmer Schuh einfach Geox.
"Son muy cómodas y preciosas.Quedan bien para salir.No le doy 5* porque el número 37 me venía muy justo y me compré el 38, y éste me queda algo suelto, hay mucha diferencia entre números."
"Scarpe originale,calzano giusto,,, bellissime"
Son muy cómodas y bonitas justo lo esperado
Très jolie !
"Top wie alle Schuhe dieser Marke, die ich bis jetzt gekauft habe.Gerade bei Kinderschuhen lege ich sehr großen Wert auf gutes Schuhwerk. Da ist es klar, dass man die nicht für 10€ bekommt. Qualität hat eben ihren Preis und hier ist er gerechtfertigt."
"Super schöner Schuh! Farbe ist live noch schöner als auf den Bildern!Passt perfekt. Wie immer bei Superfit. Ich kaufe für meine Tochter eigentlich nur Superfit Schuhe, da hier einfach die Qualität stimmt! 👍🏽"
Hatten mehrere Modelle zur Auswahl bestellt. Dieses gefiel nicht so gut.Aber es passt super. Ist bequem.
Wunderschöne und trotzdem stabile Sandalen mit toller Sohle. Superfit ist einfach fantastisch!
"Wie erwartet sind die Super fit Schuhe wieder top. Sie sind klasse verarbeitet,  passen wie angegossen und erwarten eine lange Tragdauer."
"Ich finde das Design sehr schön. Schlicht mit ein paar kleinen Details. Der Schuh hat meiner Tochter sehr gut gefallen und ich habe ihn ein zweites Mal bestellt. Bequemer, flexibler Schuh."
Super schöne Schuhe in bewährter Superfit-Qualität!
"Nice look, good fit and very good price for this brand."
Schöne Sandale! Passt zu allem!
Schicke und bequeme Sandalen. Farbe und Größenangaben sind wie angegeben.
"Nada que ver el modelo que pedí , y debido a que soy fan de esta marca los conservaré para un regalo navideño . Los seleccionados eran con camuflaje en verde olivo y llegaron en color  amarillo fosforescente ."
"Love the shoes, hate the packaging from Amazon! This may be small to others, but I keep my boxes for all my shoes and Amazon shipped my shoes in a plastic bag instead of a box. When I received the shoes my box was destroyed."
"Me gustaron mucho pero tengo que regresar el producto porque, aunque los pedí de la talla que habitualmente uso, me quedaron muy justos tanto de lo largo como del empeine del pie. Si se deciden por ellos pidan por lo menos un número más grande del que usan."
"Muy bien producto, en caja original."
Parfait
"I wear a women's size 12 US which generally translates to a men's size 10. After reading the reviews, I ordered a 10.5 and I could not be happier! I love the look of these shoes. I removed the laces. Since the shoe fits like a sock and I don't plan on running in them, I didn't really see a point of having the laces there. Plus they kinda rubbed my foot in a weird way. They feel absolutely perfect without laces. I have a rather narrow foot. If you have a wide foot, I don't think you would find this shoe to your liking. The grey color is perfect for me and I love the little splashes on the tread at the side. I also love the weave look of the shoe. Overall, a great shoe at a great price!"
"Ive own two other HyperGEL-KAN shoes and I love them all. These shoes breathe easily and feel great once you break them in. I wear these daily. People say they run a bit small but I think for being being ""athletic"" shoes they fit different. So you should go one size bigger and give them a try."
"Very comfortable. I thought they were too small vertically at first, but after breaking them in they are very comfortable.Only good for running on flat surfaces, no ankle support. Tried running on a trail and rolled ankle within 30 seconds."
I did buy a size up due to previous reviews and I am glad I did. Shoes are very comfortable. I have a lot of issue with my arches and the balls of my feet but while wearing these shoes I have had no pain.
It was time for some new shoes so these were chosen. Great quality shoe and very comfortable. I took the shoelaces out for extra comfort and notice the fabric giving me more flexibility. Love these shoes!
Amazing shoe. Very comfortable. My size is a 10 would recommend a 10.5 or even 11 if you have a wide foot. I got an 11 and fits me great and feels good.
Top collar was to tight to get my foot inside the shoe!! That was with the laces loosened all the way !!Returned them for refund
Muy bien ! El producto TSL y como lo queria
今回初めてマムートの靴を買いました。いつも早朝に愛犬と森林公園を散歩するのが日課で、今の時期は朝露で草の上を歩くにはゴアテックスブーディ仕様でないと靴下が濡れてしまいます。問題なく散歩できてますし、ビムラムソールのデザインにもよるのでしょうが枯草等が付かなくて、そのまま車乗り込めます。サイズは少し大き目を試してみたかったです。
"This shoe is well built, one of the best looking hiking shoes I came across, above average quality and really slick design. It's a bit heavy, but it's a waterproof (GORE-TEX) hiking shoe with thick sole, so it's expected.Unfortunately, did not work for me.  Going half size up was a good decision, but the shoe feels tight around the arch, and quite rigid around the inner part of the ankle which makes it really uncomfortable. To add insult to injury (no pun intended, although I can easily imagine injuries at pressure points after long hikes), it really cuts bad into the foot just proximal to the toes, and only one shoe. Virtually impossible to walk without discomfort. Sadly, no matter how much I liked them, had to return."
I loved the shoe but unfortunately didn’t work for me. I apparently needed a wider width so have to go to a specialty store for my shoes.
"I ordered size 5 in wide, it fits me so perfect, love the design, color, very helpful for me for my 8 hours work at the hospital and it gives me height as well."
Love them . Great running shoes
Fit as expected. My husband is an iron worker. Used these less than a month and the seams are already popping/leather didn’t hold up well. They’re comfortable but that doesn’t mean much when they fall apart less than a month in.
Construction.....si vous portez du 10.... n’hésitez pas à commander du 9.5..... a part ça c’est un bon produit..... les semelles intérieures sont ordinaires aussi....vous pouvez penser à les remplacer dès l’achat
I've worn these boots to work for 10 days and the leather is already peeling and cracking. I used mink oil when new and wore them around the house for a few days to break them in. I'm a crane operator so fair to say my boots don't typically see a lot of rough environment. It's really too bad because they are very comfortable and look great.  Guess that's why they're cheap.
"Comfortable and light boot, specially like the soft rubber sole instead of soft foam, took about 2 weeks to break them in, but that’s typical. They are a snug boot, I’m a size 10 in timberland pro, or Dakota lined boot, 9-1/2 unlined dakotas,  these I went with a 9-1/2 because they are unlined, glad I did. Great price, would definitely buy them again."
"Well made and very comfortable it’s large fitting so you can go down half size. I bought the soft toe and steel toe, they look well made and hope they last"
"I bought these for my son, he was pleased said the fit was good maybe a little big in the width, overall a good workboot."
"I haven't broken them in yet but so far they are comfortable,will they last as long as my Thorogoods... to be continued..."
Hard to break in. But once they do they are comfy. Took 2 weeks to break in with mink oil
I bought these forMy husband and so far these are his favorite boots of all time :) he actually wants another pair toWear all the time and one for work cause they fit great there comfy and they look great !! Great purchase
The sole was cracked Where the sole meats the leather on the arch portion of the foot. This causes the boot to leak. Should have returned them right away. Bought 2 pairs but only 1 pair had the cracked soles.
Beautiful shoe but fits in the small size.
I am an avid cyclist and tried to make these shoes work by adjusting my cleats repeatedly and even ordered insoles. They just aren’t comfortable and make my feet hurt and toes go to sleep even though I loosen them and the fit is not tight. Will only use my Sidis now.
"Love that you can often find expensive cycling gear and reasonable prices on Amazon!  I have a slightly narrow foot and have trouble finding road bike shoes that fit my foot securely and comfortably.  These are perfect and were at least $100 more on many other websites.  Most road bike shoes that fit me are $200+, so I was relieved to snag these from amazon!"
Love these shoes! Wear them to spin class and they work perfect!
Very comfortable
Nice pair of cycling shoes.
Fake fake fake...
"In genere d'estate indosso infradito o scarpe da trekking, ma questa estate devo rinunciare a qualsiasi tipo di sandalo perché indosso calze elastiche. Ho cercato perciò scarpe che fossero il più possibile fresche, morbide, leggere, che non aumentassero troppo il caldo provocato dalle calze. Ho  avuto la fortuna di trovare queste  le Salomon Tech Lite!Semplicemente perfette.  Ed anche molto carine! son soddisfatta."
"Sehr bequemer Schuh. Guter fester Sitz, aber trotzdem locker leichtes Gefühl. Perfekt zum Spaziergang bei hohen Temperaturen."
confortable et aeré. Je trouve toutefois que salomon taille un peu grand. J'ai du changer la semelle (pour une geox cuir) celle d'origine etant tres inconfortable et j'ai egalement mis des lacets elastiques qui a mon avis tiennent mieux le pied que les lacets d'origine (trop longs a mon gout)
"There are the best water shoes I’ve worn. Super comfy, good fit, and look nice. They work well on river rock and water drains well from them. You are able to go from forest floor to river no problem. Love them!"
Ein leichter Sommerschuh zum Sport. Das Material ist wunderbar weich. Leider ist die Innensohle nicht austauschbar.
"Der Schuh ist schön luftig, angenehm breit geschnitten, nur ist mir das Fussbett im Bereich der Ferse zu hart...."
"The bottom of the shoe is solid and bendy which is great, but the sides and back of the shoe is flimsy and will be a problem around the sides of my feet."
Love the solid sole of this light weight shoe but wish I’d bought it a 1/2 size smaller.
"It’s a good looking stylish shoe, but there is slippage in the heel when walking."
"Perfectos, tal como lo esperaba. Ligeros y super cómodos"
"Der Schuh ist echt ein Hingucker. Ich finde ihn super modisch und total bequem. Die Passform ist ja sehr individuell. Damit sich da jeder selbst ein Bild machen kann, habe ich die Einlagen anbei als Foto vermessen."
"Der Schuh ist schmal geschnitten ,sitzt eher fest. Für kräftige Füsse sicherlich nicht das Beste.Das Material ist gut verarbeitet und der Schuh hat ein leichtes Gewicht, was ich sehr gut finde.Preis/Leistung ok"
"In den Schuh reingeschlüpft und habe mich „zu Hause“ gefühlt.  Der Sneeker gefällt mir optisch genau so gut, wie er mir Bein Gehen passt."
"Habe den Sneaker, nachdem ich ihn letztes Jahr in safrangelb gekauft habe, jetzt noch in dunkelblau bestellt. Bei Marco Tozzi nehme ich immer die Größe 39, normal trage ich Gr. 38. Passen perfekt und sind durch das Fußbett sehr bequem.Die elastischen Schnürsenkel sorgen für ein gutes Tragegefühl.Lieferung war sehr schnell und der Preis hat auch gepaßt."
"Schick und vor allenbequem dazu noch modisch und klasse imDesign, tolle Farbe, super leicht und gute Passform"
Bequeme Sneaker für den Übergang mit loser Lederinnensohle.Noch dazu bei dem Preis unschlagbar.
"Schnell geliefert. Farbecht, wie auf dem Foto. Gern wieder."
"Die Schuhe sind optisch ein Hingucker,dazu noch sehr bequem.Einfach Klasse!"
"Toller Schuh, passt perfekt, schöne Farbe."
"Toller Sneaker und Farbe. Hat eine gute Passform, auf die ich mich immer verlassen kann."
Ich bin ehrlich ich habe für den Preis nicht besonders viel erwartet würde jedoch überrascht. Das Material und die Verarbeitung sind echt gut. Auch der trage Komfort ist ok. Wie lange diese Schuh Sohlen halten kann ich nicht beurteilen da mir die von mir bestellten Schuhe zu gross sind. Einziges Manko sind die schnürrsenkel. Schnürt man sie normal fest drücken sie das sie im Durchmesser zu schmal und rund sind.
"Die Schuhe wurden schnell geliefert und waren nach dem Auspacken ein echter Hingucker.... sehen Klasse aus und sind sehr leicht am Fuss . Im Urlaub bei über 30 Grad gab es auch keinen  "" Butterfuss "" ..... angenehmer Tragekomfort , jederzeit wieder"
Schnelle Lieferung. Schuh ist leicht. Bequem zu tragen. Gepolsterte Laufsohle sorgt für weiches Auftreten beim laufen. Nicht Wasserdicht. Gutes Preisleistungsverhältnis. Kaufempfehlung
"Leider musste ich feststellen,dass der kauf ein großer Reinfall war ob wohl ich die größe 41 bestellt die ich bekommen habe sieht die größe wie 39 zuklein. Ich bin mehr als entäucht weil ich extra 5€ wegen schneller lieferung bezahlt die kommt 3 tage spät als die lieferung zeit stand"
"Wie beschriebenen, sehr gutes Produkt.Seriöser Verkäufer, schnelle Lieferung, ohne Beanstandungen. Bin zufrieden."
Passt genau! Toller stil
Troppo piccole
"Sehen gut aus, lassen sich gut tragen. Mal abwarten,wie lange sie halten!"
Come scritto prima sono strette sul collo del piede e sono fastidiosi ad indossarle ma nell insieme e un ottimo prodotto
Finally a non-branded product that's great value and quality. Happy about my purchase.
I normally wear 7.5.  I had to return and get a 7 which is still a generous fit but works.
Llegaron muy bien
"The toe box is tight but they fit nice as long as you get the right size.  I've already owned a pair of these that I bought in a retail store and they are fantastic.  This is a replacement pair.  Can't even remember how many complements I've gotten, even from total strangers.Just remember to buy the right size LOL.  I clicked on the wrong size when I ordered so the pair I got is too small.  It was my fault though, and I'm going to just give them away to someone who might need them.  Already bought another pair in the right size (although I think they came from a different Amazon seller that time) and they are on the way."
Shoes are narrow.
"Love, super comfortable, as advertised"
bad quality!!!! dented!!! unvalued shoes!!
It’s really comfortable
Son muy bonitas pero la talla muy pequeña. Uso un 38-39 y la 39 me iba muy pequeña. Una pena que hubiera un 40
"Dopo aver acquistato alcune scarpe della Geox ho deciso di prendere anche un paio di stivaletti.COME VANNO?Abitualmente uso il 44 ma sulle calzature Geox prendo sempre il 43 e mi vanno bene. Ho fatto così anche in questo caso e mi sono trovato bene.  È inutile girarci intorno, non si può dare una regola precisa perché dipende dalla forma del vostro piede. In questo caso trattandosi di stivaletti dovete tenere presente che se avete le caviglie grandi potrebbe essere un problema il numero in meno e allora conviene il vostro numero usuale.MATERIALILa pelle è sempre di buona qualità. Gli stivali non sono lucidi ma piuttosto opachi quindi se vi piace la pelle lucida optate per altri modelli. A me piacciono così.CONCLUSIONIBuon prodotto. Grazie alla scuola Geox che lascia respirare il piede si sta bene e non si suda, cosa difficile con altri tipi di stivaletti. Acquisto consigliato soprattutto in offerta intorno ai 50 euro! In quel caso da prendere subito.Spero abbiate gradito la recensione. Saluti!"
"Sehr angenehm zu tragender und schöner Schuh.Was die Größe angeht, so sollte man den Fuß messen und die Größe ermitteln. Ich habe in lang geschnittenen Herrenschuhen grundsätzlich eine Größe weniger wie in Turn- bzw Freizeitschuhen, was sicherlich auch an meinem schmalen Fuß liegt.Bezüglich vermeintlicher Kratzer auf den Schuhen, die hier auch als Foto gezeigt wurden, muss man sich keine Sorgen machen. War bei mir auch der Fall und ich habe schnell festgestellt, dass es nur an zu viel Schuhcreme ab Werk liegt. Daher auf jeden Fall vor erstem Gebrauch mal mit der Schuhbürste drüber, damit dann auch Nichts abfärbt.Abzuwarten bleibt, wie haltbar Reißverschluß und Sohle sind. Die Sohle ist ziemlich dünn - wer das nicht mag, sollte einen anderen Schuh wählen."
"Bizarre,une chaussure n'allait pas du tout, la couture  était si mal faite que j'aurais pu l'arracher rien qu'en tirant un peu...De plus la languette extérieure n'était pas droite, et enfin les deux languettes ne présentaient pas du tout du tout la même longueur.Je veux bien que deux chaussures d'une même paire puissent être différentes, mais là c'est vraiment bizarre.Et j'ajouterai que la référence inscrite à l'intérieur n'était pas complète - rien de dramatique à ce niveau-là mais assez suspect pour que j'achète cette même paire chez un concurrent - et là bizarrement, aucun problème d'aucune nature...De là à parler de contrefaçon, il n'y a qu'un pas...Très déçu et je ne ne les recommande pas - pas chères mais pas de qualité - et ça se voit."
"Habe den Schuh in 42 bestellt nachdem ich gelesen habe das Sie zu groß ausfallen. 41 haette auch locker gereicht.Das Leder ist nicht 100% glatt aber das ist für ein echtes Leder irgendwie ok.Nicht ok ist die Verarbeitung, nach 2maligen Tragen verliert der Schuh seine Form, es fehlt ein festeres Gewebe das das weiche Leder in Position hält."
"Hatte aufgrund der vielen negativen Bewertungen, dass der Schuh viel zu groß ausfallen würde, Größe 45 statt 46 bestellt. Leider ein Fehler, da die 45er zu klein sind. Gar nicht unbedingt von der Größe der Sohle her, aber vom Knöchel und der Ferse hat es doch unangenehm und deutlich gedrückt. Daher nun 46er bestellt, ich habe immer so zwischen 45 und 46, je nach Hersteller und die passen nun perfekt und sitzen bequem. Insofern nicht unbedingt eine, oder zwei Nummer zu groß. Zumindest nicht bei mir. 4 Sterne, da leichte Spuren auf der Oberseite zu sehen sind. Dies mag bei dieser Lederart vorkommen, jedoch ist dieser Umstand eben keine 5 Sterne wert, wenn diese direkt bei Neuen Schuhen auftritt. Ich hoffe das Paar begleitet mich langjährig als komfortabler und ab und an getragenes Schuhwerk. Geruch ledrig angenehm, Sohle aus Kunststoff."
"Articolo ricevuto in una scatola non originale alla sua, prodotto usato con evidenti difetti e tanti graffi nella parte davanti, sulla punta. Pagati come nuovi e ricevuti usati. Sono talmente arrabbiato che avvio subito il reso. Amazon, grande delusione questa volta!"
"Etwas zu groß als meine gewöhnliche Schuhgröße, ReißVerschluss ist solide, optisch hätte ich mir es feiner vorgestellt, in Wahrheit sieht es fast so aus wie als hätte man Gummistiefel halbiert. Dennoch erfüllt es seinen Zweck, Material ist in Ordnung."
"Buenos botines.  Buen acabado y una piel muy buena.  Muy cómodas, como zapatillas.  Una muy buena compra"
Chaussures dans état LAMENTABLE le cuir est usé et ou griffé dur 60% de la surface !!!Le tout envoyé dans une boîte deux fois trop grande pour les maintenir correctement.Paire commandée en remplacement d'une première commande arrivée dans les même conditions. Je vous conseille vivement d'inspecter votre stock car n'a de geox que l'étiquette... Retour dès demain.
"Wie von der Marke erwartet, passt wie angegossen, gute Verarbeitung und sehr schnelle Lieferung. Gerne wieder."
"These sneakers are attractive, lightweight, and the overall construction seems good. I appreciate how the entire sole is rubber and not mostly foam like other kids' sneakers. The sizing (like other sneaker companies) is strange. I usually purchase one or two sizes bigger than what my kids wear in most other shoes. My kids also gravitate to the ""wide"" width even though they don't have wide feet. Those last two things are specific to my kids and how they fit in the sneakers, but once I figured these out, we were set.The reason for the 3 star rating: After cutting the tag off these sneakers and discarding the box when my son gave them the thumbs up, I realized the laces are FIXED and UNADJUSTABLE. There is no way to loosen or tighten them because the tops of the laces are glued to the shoe!After wearing them for a couple days, my son commented on how loose they felt. The elastic is not hefty and they already started to lose elasticity. It would not take much time for them to become way too loose.Finally, I had no choice but to cut the elastic laces out and replace them with different laces. It was still problematic because the top hole (where the original ones were glued) was unusable for the new laces. The sneakers are still somewhat loose because my son can't lace and cinch the new laces as high as he should be able to.Bottom line: these sneakers turned out to be a mess. I've been pleased with New Balance in the past and will continue to purchase their products. BUT, I will absolutely make sure I never purchase sneakers with unadjustable, fixed laces again!"
"What’s not to love? This may be the BEST shoes for kids! It is my absolute favorite of all the amount of shoes ever purchased for my kids, this is hands down the most amazing pair. It does not require the kids to tie (faster for kids to put on), comfort fit, great colors and design, no snagging on the tongue of shoes nor does it elastic on the “laces” become loose! Even my kids say it’s now their favorite. Wished the shoes industry would make more of these for kids!! The best invention of shoes for kids. You will not regret purchasing!"
"far too often I find myself writing reviews saying others knew what they were talking about.  My son has fairly narrow feet but after wearing these 1 or 2 times he told me they weren't comfortable and pointed to the end of the 'laces' as hurting.I believe the problem is that the elastic ""laces"" don't adjust very much.  I was able to pull the elastic out there and make a little bit of an adjustment so hopefully we can get SOME wear out of them...wish I could return them though.If your child has wider feet, as mine always have been, you shouldn't even consider this product."
"we’ve saved ourselves some drama getting ready for school in the morning because these shoes are lightweight and easy to get on and off. Another reviewer said the elastic laces make them a little big, but we haven’t found that to be true in our case- I assume it depends on how they’re sized to your child.We also got a really good deal on these!!"
"My 10 year old son picked these out. They looked really good and fit him well. The only problem is the elastic laces. When he runs, plays or makes a cut, his foot slides out. He really did not like wearing them because he could not play in them. I had to cut out the elastic laces and replace them with regular tennis show laces."
"These shoes are FANTASTIC!  I have 2 boys who constantly run around with their shoes untied.  These have been a life saver for kids who have not yet learned to tie their shoes.  Plus they are stylish, sturdy, and reasonably priced.  I came back the website just to order more sizes as they grow, don't ever get rid of this product!"
"Super lightweight, nice shoes. The only thing is bc of the elastic laces, they are a little loose if your child has narrow feet. Great price and came quick."
"These sneakers slip on easily. They were labeled wide width but I don’t find them very wide. They are a full size larger on my son’s foot, but the 10.5 W shoes we have from New Balance are too short! Off sizing. Nice color and quality overall. A lightweight sneaker."
These shoes are great for my little guy. They're comfortable and they are really nice looking. He has wide feet and typically has a problem with other shoes. He LOVES these.  I actually didn't know when I purchased them that they were slip ons and didnt have actual laces. This made him even more happy. Great buy!
"I have never tried New Balance for my 3 almost 4 year old before. He is disabled and stride rites always seem to fit him wide. These little New Balance shoes fit him perfectly. He has room to grow, they are narrow enough that I don't have to purchase special narrow shoes and with the stretchy faux ties he is trying to put them on himself."
"2 Things: 1- it is true size (a lot of the shoes on Amazon, may not be , but this is..), so if you are size 8, order 8 not 81/2. 2- They are one of the comfortable ones in maybe hundreds.. because I have had to order more than 20 different models, to finally find this to be only the 2nd one that was as comfy a fit as it looks, plus it is an Adidas, so it is quality.The problem: it was used and the box and inside of it were reallllly bad too, and they lie easily : When I ordered it, it said there was only 1 left(Which I got) , but just before returning them, I checked again, and no messages like that!!!! so my rating applies to ""This particular pair ONLY"" ... BUT THE SHOE IS A GREAT SHOE.."
Fits perfect to size and I love the color!
"the shoes are for man , not for woman, as they say in the description."
Everything is okay 🤣
I love them I just wish they had them in my size in the white
Buenas y cómodas de calidad media
I have a wider foot and these fit great. Super comfortable and easy to wash (after being out in the mud I put them through the washing machine and they came out good as new).
"Love these! So light, comfortable, and look super cute!"
"Good looking shoe. The cloud foam cushion it came with took me about five minutes to dislike because your toes roll over the edges and that’s soooo annoying. But determined to want to keep them because they are attractive and slip on (I wanted them for a work from home house shoe.) I put a pair of Dr. Scholls in soles inside them. They’d been in an old pair of sneakers so I could easily give that a try and let me tell you ... it worked splendidly!! I now LOVE these shoes. They are like walking on marshmallows. True to size. Attractive. Super comfy. Downside is that I ran an errand the first day I had them and something was poking me in the foot so I looked and an earring without a back had picked completely through the cheap sole. Not a huge big deal but worth mentioning. I’d say if you’re looking for a “house slipper” quality shoe ... this is it. Throw in a pair of insoles and they work great. Without the insoles, I would have had to return them."
I really dont like these. They fit strange and are not comfortable. I have several pairs of sneaker type shoes for work and these are at the very bottom of my rotation to wear. Wish i had just gone to kohls or something to try before i bought them. They are narrow and too big. This is the size i normally buy in shoes but they are too big length wise and too small width wise for my feet.
"I bought these shoes for casual, comfy days.  Do I plan on running in these?  No.  In all fairness, I probably wouldn’t run in any shoes (unless I was being chased by a predator or running for the last bar of chocolate on earth).  These shoes were instantly comfortable. I wear a 9-9.5.  The ball part of my foot is med to wide; the heel of my foot is narrow. These work great.  I ordered 9.5 and these are true to size. They have a slight stretch in toe box to accommodate width. I can tied the securely so the heel fits. I love the cushy memory foam. I plan on wearing these at Disney, they are that comfortable.  They look pretty good. If I survive walking 5-10 miles at Disney, I will come back and update my post Disney experience. If I don’t survive, it probably was no fault of these shoes. I’d say one too many ice creams or getting into deadly fight triggered by one too many renditions of “It’s a Small World.”"
"Our daughter is a varsity basketball player.  Most players finish practice and go to their ""slides"".  She wanted something that was easy to slip into but still secure as she has to drive about 30 miles to the practice facility.She loves them and wears them all the time.  Around the house, running errands, pre & post practice.  She says that they are super comfortable.  Highly Recommend."
"I am highly impressed with these tennis shoes. Very comfortable. I have worn them for 16 hours straight with no problem! This is huge for me because my arches usually start to hurt. No problems at all. Fits true to size. Light-weight, and love the style."
These shoes DO feel like a cloud. They are so comfortable. I've never owned any adidas but I'm so glad my friends told me to buy these. They feel like sneaker slippers due to not having a shoe tongue...they feel great to run in. I would only suggest to size down though! Got a 9.5 and could have easily done a 9.
These are comfortable and I love that they are pull on. I love the simple and classic design. They definitely run big- Amazon said “fits as expected” and recommended a size 10. I got a 9.5 based on other people’s reviews and actually could have gone with a 9. So they are comfortable for walking but I would not want to run in them! I would buy again but definitely recommend going down a size or two.
Love these shoes!  I am a teacher and I am on my feet all day.  I love these shoes and highly recommend them.
"Converse All Star hi Canvas perfettamente originali vendute e spedite da Amazon ,ho controllato anche nel sito web delle converse e la scarpa ė perfetta , pagate 50€ in offerta direi che ci siamo. Per la taglia io porto il 42 e ho preso la taglia 41 (corrisponde a 26 cm scritto nell'etichetta delle scarpe)  che ė perfetta come calzata. Nella pagina del venditore c'è una foto con le taglie ma secondo me quelle non corrispondono anche perché se avessi preso la tg 42 mi sarebbe risultata grande."
La marca se nota en su calidad. Son muy cómodas y se ajustan perfectamente al pie/tobillo pero sin exficcia. La verdad es que la suela también es cómoda parece que vueles por su elestucidad. Un producto 100% recomendable.
All'interno verso la punta  c'è una cucitura mal rifinita che irrita il dito del piede quindi le uso se nn è previsto lunghe passeggiate. Peccato perché sono molto carine
"Puedo decir que son las ALL STAR auténticas. Hice la comprobación con las mismas que me compre en la tienda Converse y no he encontrado ninguna diferencia, además que son igual de cómodas, cosa que con algunas imitaciones que he comprado la comodidad no está presente aunque parezcan la original."
Converse Unisex-Erwachsene Chuck Tailor All Star Sneaker .... halt der Klassiker. Aussehen und Qualität wie erwartet sehr gut. Also die Kult Chucks die in keinem Schuhschrank fehlen sollten.
"Las regale, y le quedan perfectas!!!!"
Oggetto conforme con quanto ordinato e arrivato molto in anticipo (dichiarato 28 maggio arrivato il 10 maggio).Molto soddisfatto dell'acquisto.
"le compro abitualmente, sempre tutto ok"
Un  grande classico a un prezzo vantaggioso.
"Sehr bequemer Schuh, auch zum lange laufen."
"El acabado es d e primera, la comodidad casi de 10, el pero es un relieve de la costura a nivel del talón de aquíles, roza un poco dando una leve molestia. Son livianas, muy suaves para caminar, con un toque elegante. Finalmente le quito dos estrellas, porque las dos zapatillas me han hecho daño en el talón de aquíles, de que sirve unos zapatos tan chulos si no puedes caminar mucho con ellos. No las devuelvo porque ya han sido usadas. 🤦‍♂️. Agregó que la zapatilla derecha tiene la lengua mal cocida. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️. Ver foto."
ich habe etwas breite Füße und mir passt der Schuh gut. Für den Preis macht auch die Qualität einen guten Eindruck
"Scarpa ginnica carina. Ne ho acquistate due a pochi giorni di distanza perché in offerta entrambe. Pagate una €19 e l'altra poco più di €19 forse se ricordo bene €19.39. Due paia di scarpe a nemmeno il prezzo di una! La mia preferita è quella color salmone perché ha un colore più marcato. Comunque ho acquistato la mia solita taglia che normalmente acquisto per le Diadora cioè mezzo numero in più (38.5). Io calzo 38. Però questo modello di scarpa a mio parere non serve il mezzo numero in più ,un 38 mi sarebbe comunque andato bene perché la pianta della scarpa è molto larga. Per quanto riguarda l'uso della scarpa, deve essere indossata nelle mezze stagioni, non è invernale."
"Purtroppo la scarpa era troppo stretta nonostante avessi preso mezzo numero in più e ho dovuto restituirle perché ero prossima alla partenza per le ferie ma il venditore è stato molto disponibile, gentile e corretto."
Non ho ancora indossato le scarpe perchè sono ancora un po' leggere rispetto la stagione. Devo dire che comunque le ho indossate in casa  e mi sono trovata bene. Aspetto la primavera inoltrata per poterle usare all'aperto e vedere come  vanno.
Mi ha affascinato il colore.Purtroppo mi aspettavo pesassero di meno.Non trovo indicata per lunghe passeggiate.
"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Ottimo prodotto numero esatto scarpa comodissima ottimo"
Nonostante abbia preso un numero in più all’inizio erano strette. Ho dovuto metterle “in forma”.Mi piacciono comunque molto.
Il prodotto é prodotto dai produttori. In base all'acquisto sembra essere perfetto in quanto avevamo ordinato questo e NON é arrivato un koala. Perfette. Bellissime. Ne compreremo altre per fargli compagnia.
Carine e finora robuste. Comode per l'uso quotidiano ma non per lunghe camminate.
"Scarpe comperate per mia moglie, le indossa da giorni e dice che sono comodissime. Ottime"
Ne ho acquistato più paia sono comodissime e belle
"Sandali discreti ma non mi fanno impazzire. Uno degli aspetti positivi e che sono semplici da mettere ai piedi della piccola, inoltre hanno un sistema di chiusura a velcro che permette di adattare al meglio la calzatura alla misura del piede. La suola è troppo ampia secondo me: la piccola ha avuto bisogno di un po’ di tempo per abituarsi. sono troppo rumorosi quando si cammina. Potevano costare qualcosina in meno"
"Sehr schöne Schuhe. Meine Tochter 5 zieht sie sehr gern an. Sie hat einen sehr schmalen Fuß, durch die Klettachnallen sitzt der Schuh schön eng am Fuß. Superleicht sind sie zudem auch noch! 👍"
"Talla perfecto,y súper cómodas"
"These are cute but were too “clunky” for my 3 1/2 year old. They didn’t adjust small enough to fit her and the base of the sandal didn’t bend so she was unable to walk in them. We returned them, which the seller was great about. I would not recommend for littler kids, but perhaps ages 6 and up."
"These are nice, casual summer sandals -- great for beach, pool, etc.  Daughter loves them!  Sizing seems OK in the kids' sizes.  The main drawbacks we see so far are:1. the rainbow-colored straps show dirt very easily, and2. while the foam footbed is soft & comfy, it will wear down fast"
I wanted to love these shoes for my daughter BUT they were too small. We were sent a infant size and that’s not what I purchased. When receiving these shoes off the bat I realized these were something for looks rather than looks and being comfortable for my toddler to either A dress up in and B be able to walk for hours in them without cutting in to her feet. Sadly these weren’t what I thought they were!
These are the best shoes for kids! So comfortable and they last for a long time!
"These have been the perfect summer shoes for my 7 year old daughter. She can run and play in them and they hold up great. I bought a second pair because we love them so much. And super stylish, surfer-like look too."
Cute and comfy sandals- fits perfectly on my daughter.
Bien
ほかのアシックスに比べて、指先が押される気がしますが、走りやすさと機能は最高です！タイムも上がりました！ ただ、今回、慣れてないだけなのか？長めの距離を走ったら、小指の痛みが気になりました。
他のシリーズ履いてましたが今度はこれに挑戦。かなりがっしりしてて、ソールの前もかなり反ってるので、ウオーキングには不向きです。ジョギングにはいいですね。
今まで同じ物を履いていて一番合っているので今回お買い得だった為購入しました。
Muy bonito. Muy cómodo. Muy bueno
Muy bonitas y elegantes. Muy buenos materiales y acabados
"Très belles chaussures, très confortables, pointure juste.J'en suis très satisfait !"
"Tengo cogida la talla en Clarks tengo un 44 y pido siempre 44,5, son perfectos y comodos"
"Los zapatos son frescos y cómodos, ideales para el verano, pero con el calor aparece una marca que coincide con el pegamento interior que parece unir el protector de la puntera, y no logro quitarlo con una toallita ni nada por el estilo, por lo que, después de usarlos dos veces, los llevas marcados sin remedio.No los volvería a comprar."
"Son unas zapatillas de tela de calidad aceptable pero peor a lo acostumbrado en Clarks. Quedan un poco apretadas en el empeine pero puede ser porque lo tengo un poco alto, pero en cambio otros Clarks del mismo número me quedan bien."
Il prezzo per delle clark ottimo. Il prodotto è perfetto e carino. È anche solido . Soddisfatto
"Muy malos, los tuve que devolverParece que no sean Clarks"
"Una scarpa eccellente, già acquistata sul sito della casa produttrice a prezzo pieno e comprata nuovamente nell'altra colorazione a metà prezzo (41€) su amazon. Un affare! Scarpa leggera e comodissima."
El producto nuevo y sin marcas de uso. Calidad y comodidad. Pero la caja vino completamente rota! Si fuera un regalo sería inaceptable. Tienen que mejorar el cuidado en el envío
"Si, me ha, gustado mucho, el diseño y la comodidad"
cómodos y frescos para el verano
"Die besten Sommerschuhe, die ich je hatte. Sie sehen ultraschick aus, sind qualitativ hochwertig und man läuft wirklich wie auf Wolken."
Ich habe drei Paar dieser Hausschuhe Größe 29 bestellt. Alle Schuhe wurden ohne Innensohle geliefert. Was nun ?Ich habe diese Hausschuhe in der Vergangenheit regelmäßig  mehrfach bestellt und war immer sehr zufrieden.Ohne Innensohle bieten diese Schuhe keine Tragequalität. Eigentlich 5 Sterne leider jetzt nur 1
"Se las compré a mi hijo de 10 años y le quedan perfectas, muy cómodas."
Sind wirklich gut und Qualität stimmt auch
Beautiful but too small. I ordered the wrong size
schnelle lieferung ware ok gerne wieder
The shoe itself was exactly what I had expected. I bought this to replace a worn pair at the same size and this was larger somehow than my previous pair. Pretty sure that I haven't shrunk since I purchased the last pair sooooo.
Love these shoes. They fit my big feet (size 12) perfectly
Super comfy and easy to slide on. Used them almost all the time till my previous pair literally gave out... which is when I bought the exact same pair.
Most comfortable shoes I own.  Look great too! I love these shoes.
Love them
I love these sneakers (I bought 2 in white - in case one pair needed a wash!) and I think I'll get another n a color.
I have always liked Sherry shoes and these were a good price
The shoes were as advertised and arrived on time.
The shoes are a bit tight (no wide width available) but the length is accurate.  Good quality and very nice looking.
Love them

"Schuh passt sehr gut,  sehr"
"gute Qualität der Schuhe, passen wie erwartet, sehr bequem"
"Man sollte allerdings auf die Größe achten er fällte sehr groß aus, besser eine Nummer größer kaufen,"
"Coming from a Moab Vent and Moab 2 Vent user, I was a bit skeptical that any other Merrell could provide the same comfort, but man do these things rock!.I have wide and flat feet so my shoe choices are somewhat limited. I originally chose the Moab Vents because of their out-of-the-box bang-on comfort and fit (you could buy those at the store and head directly to the trail head, they were that good). As I got more educated on what makes a good hiking shoe, I started to notice that my Moabs were a little too stiff and honestly didn't cinch down enough for my ankles (They always felt loose on me, going down half a size didn't help).After my Moab 2s finally cried Uncle, I looked for a bit more athletic hiker, not a Trail Runner, but something more streamlined with a bit less of a profile and footprint. I came across the Alverstones and after reading countless reviews, I saw the magic words, ""Large Toebox"" and ""Great for wide feet"". I got them delivered and threw them on for a quick 3-miler on varied terrain, and I gotta say these are my new hiking shoes. The fit is on a another level, so much more secure than the Moab 2s, and the footprint is just streamlined enough to where I don't feel boxy and like I'm wearing hiking boots (The Moab footprint was a bit too big for my taste). The quick-lacing system cinches down securely and the design of the tread allows for fast-paced hikes, which is what I enjoy.I do agree with others that the insole needs to be swapped out ASAP, especially for someone like me with my foot issues, not a problem as I just swapped out the aftermarket insoles I had in my Moab 2s.It's only been one hike, but I love them so far and don't see any issues coming up in the future."
"The threads are showing on both toe covers in under 100 miles.  I've been walking everyday in these shoes for just under 4 weeks, which I average about 3 to 4 miles per day.  I probably have about 80 - 90 miles of mostly neighborhood walking with very little trail exposure.I'm filing a defect return with Merrell and will have to see how this goes.As for the fit, I initially struggled with trying to like these, as these are slightly wider than my prior Merrells.  I'm an 11W, and I really have to pull the laces tight to get the right fit, but I've been satisfied with comfort after the first day.The first 1 mile I had these on I was very doubtful.  One foot felt off centered, the other ankle lace was digging into my skin.  However, after taking the shoes completely off and checking my socks the soles and lacing up again, I've been happy every since.  So, don't be completely discouraged by first impressions, it may just take a little adjusting."
"First I want to say that I am a woman and I buy men's shoes to get the width I need.  I have a neuroma in one foot and a fibroma in the other, along with high arches.  I need very wide shoes and lots of cushioning.  I purchased 4 pairs of Merrell hiking shoes at the same time, and this pair is the only one that was comfortable for me, so the others were returned.  I tried Moab 2 Vent in 2 widths, and Moab Edge 2.  I wear a size 8 to 8.5 in women's shoes, mostly wearing wide shoes like Altra and Crocs.  In a men's shoe I go down 1 to 1.5 sizes.  In this shoe a men's 7 wide was perfect.  No, you won't get the Vibram sole, but comfort was more important to me than the sole material."
"Total disappointment; you certainly don't get what you pay for ($80.00) with these.  Merrell is supposed to be a good name with a good reputation for quality shoes, but unfortunately it hasn't been my experience with the last to pairs of hiking shoes I've purchased of theirs.I had these barely 4 months and both heels already had holes worn through the sole.  See attached pics.  Merrell minimizing material costs by reducing the thickness of the sole is just unacceptable for an $80.00 shoe.I certainly won't be purchasing Merrell any longer....Columbia are on my radar now."
"Delivery was on time and no damages. As with all the other Merrell footwear I have purchased, these shoes are of the quality I expect from them. This is first time I have ordered Merrell products on Amazon, so not sure if that is the reason for my issue. I order 10.5 US from Merrell for all my hiking and general purpose shoes, but these seem about half an inch shorter in length than all my other 10.5 Merrell shoes. And I found out that Merrell lowered their price of this shoe to $80 - so I did not save any money by buying from Amazon! Lesson learned! I will NOT be purchasing footwear from Amazon in the future. I paid the same on Amazon as Merrell's website, and the fit is not the same as I expect. Tried to save a few dollars and screwed myself."
"I have had a pair of Merrell Moab Hiking Shoes that I use almost daily for my walking regiment and I have also used them twice walking sections of the Appalacian Trial and they have worn like iron. The only place they have shown much wear is the back of the shoe at the heel. I have had my Merrell Moab hiking shoes for over four years and they don't look too bad for ""old hiking shoes"" but because I have used them more lately for mowing the yard and working in my garden they just aren't ""pristine"" looking enough for wearing to outdoor picnics, parties, and eating out with my wife. I saw the Merrell Alverstone Hiking Shoes and liked the way they looked and the good price for them so I figured is they were anyway as good as the Merrell Moab Hiking Shoes I would be happy with them. So far I really like my new Merrell Alverstone Hiking Shoes. The fit was good right out of the box and I have had no problems doing by 1.5 to 2 mile daily walks with them. It's like they were already ""broken-in"" and I don't get any blisters or sore areas on my feet or heels from using them new right out of the box."
"Updating my review (below) after I've been wearing these shoes for about two weeks.In addition to being smaller than the actual size and too narrow, they do not have much cushioning, which causes some heel pain after a long walk. I would return them but my guess it is too late.Previous review:These are indeed fine-looking shoes, comfortable and cushy. Hopefully, they will serve me well.On the downside, they are not exactly true to size: size 11 actually feels like 10.5. Also, they are moderately uneven: left shoe looks somewhat narrower and slightly curved toward the inside."
"From my personal experience these don't even come close to moabs. Tried them hoping to get a good pair of Merrills for less then what I was used to spending.  I regret the decision. While they fit well enough, and have plenty of space. They don't provide the same support. 2 months in and my feet hurt walking in them for extended periods of time. It took my last pair of moabs well over a year to get to this point.  Unfortunately I'll end up buying a new pair of shoes much sooner then expected because I tried to save a few bucks."
I ordered these in a wide since I've been having issues with other shoe manufacturers being too small and tight but I could have gotten by with the standard width. I will continue to by Merrell shoes since they last forever and their shoe size fits as expected.
"Ho acquistato queste scarpe per la nuova stagione, avendo già avuto altre Mizuno nelle stagioni precedenti, e le sto usando da settembre. La scarpa è esteticamente bella, ed è molto comoda. Le prime volte che si indossano risultano molto fascianti, quasi strette, ma dopo qualche giorno di utilizzo si lasciano andare, senza però diventare larghe. Offrono un'ottima stabilità e ammortizzazione.Peccato però che dopo qualche mese di utilizzo si siano già rovinate parecchio..."
"arrivate oggi e provate stasera in campo. vestibilità: a primo impatto sembra stretta ma già  dopo il primo set la scarpa prende la  forma del piede. gradita sorpresa il livello di ammortizzazione della suola: ho problemi alle ginocchia e queste scarpe mi hanno aiutato parecchio. tengono fermo il piede rimanendo leggere, ottima risposta negli spostamenti in campo."
"Arrivate con un giorno di ritardo, ma avvertito della cosa.Prodotto corrispondente alla descrizione, di ottima fattura e molto stabili e comode."
Preis Leistung super
"Ho dovuto rendere il prodotto, ped me era troppo stretto, soprattutto dal collo del piede . Comunque la scarpa è molto carina ."
Scarpa morbida e leggerissima. Forse un po' stretta per chi ha la pianta larga. Consegna velocissima come sempre.

"Love the shoe. Fit true to size. I will say though for anyone with a high instep, it might be a little difficult to get in."
Shoes are very Light Weight. Perfect for running and jogging. Looks also good. Can be worn in casual parties

Excelentes y precio bajisimo.
Comodissimi è di ottima qualità
Just to say excellent thanks
I sandaletti sono comodi è abbastanza facili da indossare però bisogna fare attenzione alle taglie che non sono proprio bilanciate il rischio è che siano piccole 24/25 o un po’ grandi 26/27 . Io ho optato per un po’ grandi e penso che le utilizzerò anche l’anno prossimo.
Le scarpe sono morbide e leggere. Unica cosa che il materiale le pizzica la pelle dopo un pó. Quindi credo che gliele metteró con delle calzine.
Mon fils fait du 25 et la taille 24/25 est grande

"Chaussures pour enfant ultra souple,  jolie couleur.  Et surtout très pratique car l'enfant peut courir,  sauter, se mouiller les pieds en toute sécurité."
"Acheter pour la plage finalement devenu les sandales de l'été. Adaptées comme prévu aux pieds, facile à utiliser et une bonne accroche aux talons sans douleur et autres problèmes. Un jeu d'enfant, notre fils de 2 ans et demi les enfile et retire tout seul ce qui est pratique lorsque qu'elles se retirent du pied surtout dans la folie du jeu des enfants de cet âge."
Jolies chaussures mais pas adaptées aux pieds fins car pas d'adaptation possible à la cheville .Chaussure à enfilée sans attache de cheville . Mon fils les perd en marchand :/

Chaussures aquatiques de qualité. Tiennent très bien aux pieds. Joli design
Déçue car je les trouvais jolies. Mon fils était entre deux tailles. Renvoyés.
"Ricevuto con i tempi concordati.Il prodotto lo conoscevo, perchè già acquistato.Ottima qualità, identico al precedente."
Arrivo puntualissimo. La scarpa calzava perfettamente.
Belle e comode
The shies are very nice and comfertable as well its great for the spring tume and summer of course id recommend you buy them i bought every color
"I'm already 6ft but I was curious how this works.  I figure women can automatically grow 3 inches taller with high heels, why can't guys try it?Well it did work with the height jump.  It's amazing feeling walking in a public place and all of the sudden looking down more on people's heads.  The only downside it they begin to hurt your feet after an hour or so.  It's not horrible and maybe that's what women deal w/ via high heels.  But if there was a way around this it would be nice."
Purchased these shoes for my Fiance to wear at our wedding in hopes it would give a little more height in our pictures.  We love them.  They look better in person!  My Fiance said they fit very comfy.  I guess the true test will be on our wedding day but so far everything looks great!!
Walking in them feels absolutely terrible. Like walking in loose heels or something. Perhaps feels better if they fit.
Too tight.
"Great shoe, high quality. The extra height adds confidence."
"I was shocked of the quality, perfection in every way, they are very comfortable, a little loud when walking on hard Floors but other than that they are amazing."
Nice elevation and style but toe area is tight and it hurts after a while
"Me agrado el estilo, la elegancia y el Material de confección"
It's a little to moderately tight across the toe area!
El precio es genial. La marca es de mucha calidad por lo que la oferta es lo que me convenció para la compra
Top class product. High quality. Original. Perfect fit. Very comfortable. Nice colour. Bought for my wife. She is liking it a lot.
Shoes fit well with socks. Comfortable and great for long brisk walk or run.Foot width matches perfectly. No soreness felt in either foot . Great product .Worth the money and meets expectations.
Da menos talla y de la punta es muy cerrado
Not fit for sports person.it fales side when we run.
Prima
Es muy cerrado y duro en el empeine; si es como la foto pero lo compré un poco más grande para que no me molestara en la parte trasera del pies y al caminar me saco ampolla
"Trotz gleicher Schuhgröße und scheinbar gleichem Nachfolgeprodukt des Nike Shield Zoom Winflo 4 ist der Schuh viel zu klein ausgefallen. Versand, Zustellung und Rücknahme waren in Ordnung."
Perfect shoes for Running!!
"Wrong description by Amazon. It is not size 4.5 UK, but 4UK."
This pair of shoes is amazing.  My first good pair of running shoes since i started running last year.  This size fits me perfectly and I have an average width foot for a lady. I also have a high arch and these support me well. No foot pain on my walk/ run with these shoes.  I haven't tested out the water resistance on them yet because they look too good to get dirty.  Would definitely recommend this shoe.
"Die Größe passt wie erwartet - hier entspricht die 38 auch einer 38. Ich habe vorn einen recht breiten Fuß und die Schuhe bieten genug Platz ohne zu drücken. Die Verarbeitung ist gut und ich finde sie lassen sich vielseitig zu Hosen, Leggings und Kleidern kombinieren."
"Pies tal cual en la fotografía, es un diseño bonito y cómodo. Para quiénes busquen un pie de gato confortable con una suela plana. Los recomiendo tanto para iniciación como niveles intermedios. Para vías más agresivas según gustos me iría a una forma asimétrica. Pies de gato indicados para pies con forma egipcia. Buen soporte en el talón, buen ajuste gracias a los cordones y añadir que es un pie de gato con horma estrecha, por lo que a mi concretamente me han encajado a la perfección para mis pies estrechos.Como recomendación para iniciación comprar vuestra talla que soléis utilizar en calzado normal sino estáis habituados a llevar el pie apretado, una más en un par de meses notaréis el pie demasiado flojo y os dará desconfianza. Son de piel y estiran.Para orientaros porque no encontraba tabla exacta con cms yo pedí 3 tallas diferentes para comparar y ver qué necesitaba la 36 2/3 son 23cm, 37 1/3 son 23,5 y la 38 son 23,7.Espero que os sirva de ayuda y referencia."
"Son los primeros pies de gato que tengo. Los he utilizado para Boulder y muy bien.Primeramente pedi 37 1/3 ya que suelo calzar un 37, pero tuve que cambiarlos por un número más, el 38 perfectos."
"Es ist ein guter Anfängerschuh, guter Grip, für Kletterschuhe sehr bequem, durch Schnürsenkel perfekt für schmale Füße. Bei einem Gebrauch von 1x die Woche hat sich nach ca. 3 Monaten leider an einigen Stellen die Sohle gelöst, jetzt nach 5 Monaten kann ich ihn ausrangieren, weil sich die Sohle an den Seiten komplett schält."
Había oído que esta marca de zapatos es comodísima y lo confirmo. Ideas para ir tanto con pantalones como con vestido o falda. Muy bonitas y modernas.
"Quedan genial puestas, y muy cómodas.Pensé que por el estampado no iban a combinar mucho, pero me las pongo tanto con vaquero azul, como con gris o negro.Estoy encantada."
"Al principio un poco rígidas.. las primeras veces, te van a molestar, pero luego, comodísimas y preciosas. ¡Viva la originalidad!"
Me ha encantado el diseño y estaban a buen precio.
Estoy encantada.  Las había visten tienda más caras
Son muy bonitas como en la foto
"When I ordered this sneakers I checked the sizes. My size is 6 and in the size chart it says size 4 UK is size 6 so I clicked that. When it arrived I saw it's size 7. I had this delivered in my friend's place in USA because I lived in the Philippines. My friend brought it today. I love everything the style, color except that it's not my size. My colleagues suggested to just wear 2 socks because it's really nioce on me and it fits my personality! Is it possible to have it changed? Please let me know...."
"Ich habe inzwischen 150km im Hyperion Tempo absolviert. Vom 7km Fartlek, 10km Tempoeinheit und dem HM in 75% Pace - der Hyperion Tempo macht eine super Figur. Das Zusammenspiel von Dämpfung, Direktheit und Leichtigkeit ist aus meiner Sicht hervorragend. Doch der Reihe nach:Gewicht: Der Schuh ist nicht nur leicht, er fühlt sich auch genauso an und läuft sich, besonders bei schnellen km sehr gut. Die Mittelsohle ist nicht zu schmal aber das DNA Loft Material ist super und bietet ausreichend Dämpfung was nicht zu lasten des Gewichts geht.Dämpfung: Für reine Versenläufer ist der Schuh sicher nicht die beste Wahl, für Mittelfußläufer ist er meiner Meinung nach super. Die Dämpfung ist ausreichend, man spürt die Energierückgewinnung, wenn auch nicht so sehr wie bei einem Carbon-Schuh (kostet auch wesentlich weniger).Feedback: Die Sohle ist zwar nicht sehr dünn, aber sie gibt viel Feedback. So ist der Lauf auf sehr groben Schotterwegen eher gewöhnungsbedürftig. Auf Trailabschnitten sowie dem Asphalt spielt der Hyperion Tempo seine Stärken aus. Die Sohle ist sehr haltbar und nach den 150km ist noch kaum Verschleiss an der Außensohle zu sehen.Die Schnürsenkel sind sehr dünn und dürften etwas kürzer sein, selbst mit Runners Knot sind sie meiner Auffassung nach noch einen Tick zu lange.Alles in allem ein hervorragender schuh von Brooks - mit dem sich bei jedem Wetter laufen lässt und man lange (+650km) Spaß haben kann.Sofern die Rezension hilfreich war, freue ich mich über ein Daumen nach oben ;-)"
Scarpe molto belle e leggere.Stringhe un pochino lunghe.
"Pour la course sur route , bitume, et chemin sans cailloux, pas faite pour le trail ou chemin caillouteux.taille un peu petit, je l'ai porterai pour mon premier marathon Paris 17 octobre 2021."
"These shoes work better the faster I go. Mercury's wings on my feet. Best way to describe the feeling is with each step, it's like a little hand tapping up from the ground into my foot. Sounds crazy but the technology is there."
"Light weight, Hyperion tempo felt great even after a 10 mile race. I left them on afterwards and did not feel any discomfort. This shoe is made for competitive running and would not recommend training in them, but you can."
"Light, soft but responsive cushion, comfortable, stretchy uppers, laces that flex.  These are a dream.In the words of Drake, “You the best I’ve ever had.”"
Gift for son-in-law and he says the fit is great
You feel very quick in these shoes. Not for the beginner if training for distance running. Overall very well made. Will definitely recommend.
I am so glad I discovered the yellow box flip flops. Not only do they look and fit great but they also offer great cushion when walking and as I suffer from plantar fasciitis it is extremely helpful. I ordered two more of a different designs as soon as I received these and walked around in them for a couple of days. They are worth every penny and most likely I'll never buy another brand again. I definitely recommend this product
I love everything about these flip flops!  No pain between toes.  Cushiony foot bed.
These are amazing!  So comfortable!  Gives you a spring in your step!  Best of all the piece between your toes does not hurt!
Very comfortable and beautiful
"Comfortable, cushiony sole. Soft fabric between toe band suitable for sensitive toes or toes tightly together."
Absolutely love these flip flops. After receiving my initial order I placed a second order of two more colours.
They were suppose to be denim and they are plastic
"A little pricey for foam flip flops , but very nice and extremely comfortable. I am happy with them."
Love these so comfy worth the buy for sure
"Je les adore. La grandeur est bonne, elles sont confortables."
They are very nice shoes and I was super excited to get these shoes as I absolutely need new shoes but I was pretty upset when I tried to get my feet into them and there was just no way I could the material is not stretchy like my last pair of pumas 😔 so definitely make sure you have very slender feet before purchasing these.
"As described, unique look. Very comfortable. Worn them a few times, even shopping for at least 2 hrs. Love that there are no laces. Just slip them on and off"
I love them so much I’m a nurse and they keep my feet comfortable
These shoes are great if you work on your feet!
Its fit comfortable  very soft and nice
Amazing! Love it!
"I like these shoes as a health care worker who is on my feet for 60 hours a week,  it's all about comfort.  Stepping into these is like stepping into a pillow.  They are remarkably soft and easy on my feet."
"Puma, like Fila (the designer I wear) run tight across the foot and toe area, always for me. This shoe however runs tight across the top of the shoe. It’s how the shoe is sewn under the stretch band. I don’t like the sock shoe or boot shoe or whatever that shoe is called that doesn’t have laces and you have to wrestle with your foot to try and put them in. But these shoes I made an exception because of the style, I love it. Very uncomfortable, at first but now after several wears and washes, the shoes seem to be more tolerable. I get a lot of compliments on these shoes. I’m a 10 but I’m glad I got the 10.5, I know it made a difference in the fit...great. Too bad the bottom of the shoe wasn’t speckled in gold like the first Puma Prowl but it’s a comfortable nice shoe just the same ;)"
"I have a white pair of Puma slip on sneakers and I love them but I wore them camping stupidly and they got ruined. So I've been on the hunt for a new pair and I came across these. I liked that the style was similar to what I already have and I liked that the sliver straps were sparkly. Totally up my alley. They look exactly as shown. They shipped pretty much right away. It didn't take long to receive them. When I got them I tried them on and the ""fit"" but unfortunately even though I ordered these in my size the material that they are made with probably wasn't the greatest choice because I can see the outline of my foot with the shoe on. I can see my toes very easily. So I can imagine if I were to wear them out and about people are going to be able to see the shape of my foot and my toes move while walking. It looks very odd. They are comfortable, the material is comfortable but not a good choice. Probably for anyone. Very lightweight too. I will be returning them and continue to look for another pair."
"I really like them. They get a little uncomfortable after a while,but I guess the elastic will need time to stretch."
"See DanGeorge review it is accurate .... plus after 2days of wearing the Reebok printed label started wear off! The sole of the shoe is so thin you can feel a pebble ...... very unhappy with the supplier and with Amazon for promoting this garbage!!!!!!  And now I am out almost $130.00.  THANK YOU AMAZON!Follow-Up 05/28/21 Went to the Reebok Outlook Mall Store they told me this shoe model # is not one of theirs shoes.....I tried to make them work for a week.  They were so uncomfortable to wear I bought insoles to try to make them comfortable didn't work....after 1 day of wearing the shoes the Reebok logo printd inside the shoe was wearing away.......oh! While I was at the Reebok Store I purchased a great pair of Reebok's, very very comfortable and for only $73.00"
"Bought these in January, in April, the leather on the right shoe started to bubble. In May the left shoe outer seam ripped. I'm not doing any real activity in these, just walking - I think around 5k steps a day. This isn't the quality I remember from Reebok."
Bought for my son for work as he is on his feet all day. Great so far
El producto es de piel sintética por lo que carece de la calidad esperada. Por favor no lo publiquen así porque engañan al cliente y lo hacen dudar o convencerse de que la próxima compra volverá a ser engañado.
Good thing
Very sturdy but comfortable shoe. I have worn them for a full day on several occasions with total comfort.
Incredibly comfortable and stylish. Great shoes!
はけないことはないが，ＵＳサイズと基準が違うようだ。
"I read reviews to help in purchase decisions. So I hope this review helps you. In a shoe store using gauge I have a men's 10-1/2 D (regular width foot) actual size.  I buy size 11- Wide in everything I buy,Skechers,work boots etc.I like to ensure room for expansion and insert foot beds if needed. I bought sof sole gel insoles here on Amazon also.These arrived today, I ordered 11 X-W  They showed on order as 11 4E {?} Length is good,width is slightly snug with or without replacement insoles. If you truly have a wide foot,good luck. Otherwise the insoles are tacky stuck down but are removable,inserts make a big difference. Quality is good,bright white,look nice and yes I would recommend"
"These are fire I love them! I was scared when ordering these because they’re so cheap - less than $30 I thought they wouldn’t be authentic or made out of plastic. These are authentic, the box was in good condition all labels were on. They feel great when I put them on and I don’t see any signs of them being fake. Even have memory foam type material at the bottom feels good. I have been looking for some nice casual white leather shoes and these slap! I get mad compliments. I’m buying all these colors and will post the results. I would say that they are slightlyyyy narrow just a little. So if you have fat feet that may effect you. I didn’t let that effect the rating cause I don’t have that problem. Ima do some walking in them if they hurt my feet or somethin I’ll let y’all know."
Delivery was quick as promised. The product is the same as the one at the store for half the cost. Appears to be of the same quality. Cant say anything about the durability at this time. Fits perfectly and kids love it. Thank you. Now to find a pair for myself.
"I have a tough time sizing my kid's cleats because the shoes mostly run narrow.  Our soccer also go back and forth between turf and grass during the season, and my kid doesn't like traditional cleats (notably on harder surfaces).  He also usually blows out his shoes during a season.  This shoe gets 5 stars for lasting a season and for fitting on a little wider foot.  The grip from the shorter cleats also work well for a kid on grass (even a bigger one like mine).  Buying the adult version this year for baseball (same issue with spiky cleats, especially using artificial pitching mounds) and soccer as he has grown out of the kid size."
These are visibly way too narrow. Too narrow for the average human foot. My kid only wore them once. He said they hurt. I should’ve returned them.
My daughter loves it. She is 7 and plays indoor soccer on turf. She said the shoes are comfy and flexible. I will be being the cleata version of these for the spring season.
El producto sugiere que es talla de niños pero cuando abrí el paquete es talla de hombres! entonces mi zapato es mucho mas grande de lo que esperaba. el tono no es el mimo de la foto en la foto se ve blanco y rosado. En realidad es un tono medio brilloso blanco y un tipo anaranjadoen vez del rosa. No puedo devolver porq lo pedi por Encargo hasta ECUADOR pésimo NO COMPREN CON ESTE VENDEDOR!!
My daughter loves these shoes. They are comfortable for her and she likes the color pattern. I am planning on getting a bigger size later on.
Was a little bit bigger than expected but still nice and comfortable
Very nice
Very nice and comfortable shoes my son liked them he plays soccer with them and runs great he says they are perfect
Daughter wire these to the field right out of the box. Comfortable. Fits well.
Well made
Used for over a year and still in great shape. Even the laces are in good shape. Very durable!
"great sport shoe. good looking , great quality. perfect fit."
The shoe has held up relatively well. The shoes are lightweight and material is pretty tough. I give three out of five stars because of the toe - better reinforcement of the toes considering little boys play hard (soccer during recess) and the toes of shoes need to hold up more than two weeks to soccer ball kicks.
My daughter loves the color light pink with the grey fits well looks great.
Super cute but too narrow.
my son loves it
Perfect
Great
"These shoes are great, I had been looking for a pair of shoes that fit my feet and were comfortable for months, I had been everywhere I could think of to try and find a pair, even went to store to try shoes on all with no luck. Then I found these shoes, they fit great, it will be the first pair of shoes in years that don't break open on the sides for me and on top of that I was able to wear them right out of the box day 1 and they were comfortable. I'm on my feet a good amount of the day and wear these shoes for 12-14 hours a day and at the end of the day my feet don't hurt and I have noticed less back and leg pain since wearing these shoes. I liked them so much I turned around and purchased a 2nd pair in a different color and those are just as amazing. I would highly recommend these shoes."
"I have owned many different pairs of the ASICS Gel-Nimbus Shoes over the years and have never been disappointed with the feel, performance and look of these shoes! Can't beat the price that I purchased this new ASICS Men's Gel-Nimbus 21 Running Shoes at! Very Happy!"
"Got here fast. Nice and comfortable shoe, I wear a 9.5 and they fit perfectly. Thanks!"
Good running sneaker
They are soooo comfortable and stable! Forget about Nike! I strongly recommend ASICS. I’m very satisfied with the purchase.
Was delivered fast.
Super cool
Christmas gift for my son the runner
This was a gift for someone.
I've had a lot of Romas over time. They are great. But be sure to get a half a size larger than usual.
I love the color and how it fits on my 3 year old son. Would be purchasing another puma Roma. I delivery was faster than I expected. Love loving this shoes 😉
Loving these shoes just as image
My son loves this sneakers
It is good to know that if there were to be a problem that I could easily return.  With that being said all went well and they fit exactly as expected.  They were suppose to be for school but we had to try them out.  Perfect
"My son loves this sneakers , he is wearing it all day long"
It was a great fit
Fast delivery from USA. Quality product.
Se va el color al par de semanas
"Sehr schön leichter Schuh für den Sommer, mein Sohn liebt Sie über alles👍🏻"
Schöne Schuhe die lange halten. Bei anderen geht oft die Sohle ab.
Passt wie erwartet. Mein Sohn liebt die Schuhe
All well but the size is small than it should
Unser Sohn hat sich sofort damit wohl gefühlt. Kaufempfhelung. GUtes Material.
nachdem die Schule bei uns am Montag wieder öffnet mussten schnell neue Hausschuhe her da mein Sohn aus seinen bisher genutzten herausgewachsen ist.Wichtig war mir vor Allem das der neue Hausschuh atmungsaktiv ist damit die Füße nicht so schwitzen.Mit den Kinder Clogs bin ich diesbezüglich auch zufrieden. Sie sind leicht und luftig und mein Sohn mag sie auch. Die Größe passt gut und die Verarbeitung ist auch ordentlich.Empfehlenswert.
"Die Schuhe sind Super, sie passen sehr gut. Wir haben sie für den Garten gekauft. Mein Sohn mag sie gern und findet die Schuhe bequem. Ich würde sie wieder kaufen in der nächsten Saison."
"Es ist ein gutes Produkt, aber nicht beeindruckend, daher bewerte ich es mit drei Sternen"
"Nett, aber nach einem Monat Riemen bei beiden Kindern abgerissen."
Tutto ok
"j'aime , on est bien dedans , ils sont légers et souples"
Excelente calidad de materiales. Ligeros y cómodos
"Just the summer cricket shoe for which I have been searching. The fit is accurate, the shoe is the most comfortable in my wardrobe. I do not hesitate to recommend this product. The shoes appear well made; thye are of a quality that one expects."
I like it...
"Nice looking, comfortable, and very light."
They are used for playing the pedals on the organ!
"The best tap shoes. I'm a french tap teacher and thanks to amazon.com, I purchased professional tap shoes, that I used to buy an amazing price (250 $), for a very small price. The delivery was very fast and the product perfect. As I have a very good cobbler for the build up, I have now professional tap shoes for half price. Thank you amazon.com, I will be a returned customer.P.S. for capezio tap shoes, you have to know your perfect size before ordering."
el producto esta buen estado y llego a venezuela como se ve en la foto referencial gracia buen vendedor lo felicito
I think there is a big problem with the way this shoe is sized. I am not convinced that this shoe can be fit to a woman's foot.I ordered and tried 3 different sized pairs. The last one that I decided to keep and wear caused me very large and painful heel blisters after 20 minutes of dancing. Of course now that they are used I cannot return. $300. loss.I think you would do better with a cheaper shoe. My Blochs never caused these problems.
The shoes that were in the box were the wrong size a 13 1/2 not 12 as stated in the ad.
"Lammfell innen, echtes Leder außen, wasserfest und sieht auch noch toll aus. Meine Tochter liebt diese Stiefel."
"Die Schuhe sind zwar leider nicht sooooo weich /zu knicken wie unsere Sommerschuhe, aber für Herbst/winterstiefel sind sie perfekt. Robust und trotzdem schick"
This shoe looks good but doesn't feel good! They made a sore 😩 on my heel! I'm sticking with adidas!
"It is comfortable and nice, a good buy"
The back of the shoe is high and rubs blisters....
Sehr bequemer und schöner Schuh.Ich schwanke immer zwischen 38 und 39. Hier hat mir 39 gepasst.
"Buen articulo, esta marca me va bien"
"Be careful-- there is no realistic return policy, I like in FL and they want $100 to return"
"The shoes I received are not the same shoes pictured. The shoes pictured had a velcro strap closure. The shoes I received appear to have the same lower body, however they have  lace closures. Disappointing!"
"Sooouu...4 month old shoes. Cute, bright, fit as expected. I've owned new balance before and have always been happy with the brand. These did not hold up. My daughter barely wore them because she has many shoes. I just now realized how worn they look. In these 4 months these shoes have never been washed or cleaned (demonstrating they truly are still new) and you can see the soles are barely worn but very torn and worn on the fabric side. Pictures attached for you to use your own judgement."
En asfalto se comportan como un guante.
"These are fantastic shoes for my seven year old.  He loves them.  We ordered the white ones, which turned out having pink-lavenderish-""N""s on them.  I pulled out a black Sharpie and changed that before my son saw.  Lol.  These plastic toggles on the laces have not held up.  One is completely gone already, with another hanging by a thread.  Not sure why.  Great grip.  Easy to wipe clean."
"I purchased these for my daughter who wears a 2.5. They arrived today and she had the hardest time putting them on. When I tried I did as well but succeeded. She said they were way too tight and hurt her foot. As far as appearance, they are nice looking but you may need to order half a size up or even wide for your kiddo (we never had to buy wide for her shoes)."
"Fit as expected, however these have shown wear rather quickly. They do not tighten around my daughter’s ankles well so they rub together throughout the day as they are sticking out a bit. She says then are comfortable shoes- they just didn’t stay looking nice as long as I expected. She started wearing these late August- so this is less than 4 months of wear."
"My son has wide feet and normally has a least half an inch of toe room in a size 11. However, these shoes fit just right. I bought a wide and the shoe was snug on his foot as well with thin socks. I am returning for a larger size since I love the quality. Pictures do not do it justice! Buy the shoe but go for a larger size and XW if your child has a wide foot."
"My son is kind of particular about how his shoes look. But I picked these out without him and he loved them. The basic color is great since he wears them every day. He says they're comfortable. I bought them a little big for him to grow into, but they still work well for him. So far the quality is good. We'll see in a few more months, but I have high hopes."
"I got these for my 5 & 1/2 year old, so take that into consideration when he says they are the best shoes he’s ever worn 😄I like the fact that I could get a pair of classic trainers for him in extra wide. 3rd paid of NBs for him and will continue to do so."
"We bought these for my elementary son to run cross country.  They are well made, but do not offer as much support as some of the other options out there.  They will serve our purposes for this season, but I will likely choose something with more support next time."
"I bought this for my boy, and they came to large. On top of that its described as girls shoes , and I don’t  Find them very girly Decent looking UNISEX shoes that I hope my son will wear in near future"
Scarpe super comode e ancora più belle che da foto. Al tatto il leopardato sembra pelo vero ! Sono super contenta del mio acquisto. Ho preso un 40 e calza perfettamente.
"Le adoro, comode e chic con un tocco di stravaganza!"
Belle ma calzano pochissimo
Los zapatos me han gustado y me queda genial. Son elegantes y cómodos .
Perfetto
Parfait
Elles sont magnifiques pour elle taille petit j'ai au dessus
"ya conocia la marca, sigue siendo un producto que volveria a comprar cuando el actual se termine por el uso normal.Excelente que lo tengan como opción en Amazon"
"Geniales, el color lo que quería. El número perfecto. Quedan muy y son comodisimas. Las recomiendo y el precio, mejor que en tienda"
It fits as expected but it is very tight and I did not find a way to loosen the shoe laces.
"Camper! Toujours aussi agréable à porter, et toujours le Style !!!Camper forever !"
fit my duck shaped feeta bit tight across the toes but they will break in
They are so cute and very comfortable.
Perfect warm waterproof boot for kids in the snow
"The liner to the boot runs VERY SMALL. My toddler is a size 5, I ordered a 6, and the boot is big but the liner is tiny and very narrow. The width of the liner is seriously that of a newborn shoe. It’s that narrow and small. Her foot WILL NOT fit into it. Forget trying to put a foot with socks on it into the boot. I’m seriously debating on returning these if the liner is unusable and the boots won’t keep her feet warm without it. Without the liner it’s essentially a fancy rainboot, there is zero integrated padding/warmth into the boot."
初めてのオニツカタイガーのスニーカーでしたが、今のとこかなりいいですもう１足欲しいな
"My son is 22 months and the liner was WAY too narrow for his foot!!  Even taking the liner out and trying to get just that on him before trying the boot on, I wasn’t able to get his toes past the middle of the liner.  It was quite literally HALF the width of his wide, little baby foot!  They were also very heavy and clunky, so if we could have gotten them on, I imagine they would have been difficult for him to walk in."
"While I'm sure these are warm & I love Columbia, these boots are much too clumpy for a toddler. My one year old loves to walk & run, but in these boots she can hardly lift her feet, so insists on being carried, even when just testing them in the house. Might be fine for an older child, but I would go with Land's End in that case, anyway."
"I really wanted these boots to work! So much so that I ignored the other reviews and tried them anyway. The inside liner is not just small, but bunches up making it impossible to get a foot into them. In addition to that the shaft is so stiff it makes it challenging to get it past the ankle. I love everything Columbia, and they’re a trusted brand, but I’m so super bummed by these!"
Probably great but too hard to get on their feet. After about the third time I just didnt want to do it again so they just sat there. I got the kamiks and they slip right on perfect fit. These fit well but you almost have to break your kids leg to get them in them.
"The liner in this boot is just cheap foam. Does not even seem like it will keep a child’s feet warm. My son is a toddler size 5, that’s what was purchased. I cannot even get his foot down into the boot because they are so tight even at the ankle."
My son loves these! They are very good quality. I never have a problem with any Columbia product that I purchase.
These boots are great. They fit as expected and they are sturdy. They have held up to little boy ruff and tuff play. No matter how long they have been out or how wet the snow has been their feet come out dry. There has even been some complaints of hot feet. Which is a great thing in my book.
Great quality. Sturdy boots. My son can DESTROY any pair of boots or shoes in a week... he has many many times! But these have held up well to the abuse they take on a daily basis! Never hear conplaints about cold piggies!
"This is a well built, lightweight waterproof shoe. I'm a size 13, and it feels just a tad bit small. These shoes took a long while to break in, to the point where I almost gave up on them, which would have been a shame considering the price. About a month in, wearing them once a day for a walk, I'm at the point where I feel they are a good, quality walking shoe now that they're broken in. So far they've kept water out during light rain and small puddles."
Great
Son muy buenos y súper cómodos son una belleza 😉
Muy buen articulo
"Muy lindos y súper cómodos,a mi esposa le encantaron"
Muy cómodos
"First off, I had no problems with the seller or shipping. The problem with these shoes was that the toes have an angular design that caused my toes to get uncomfortably squeezed, and they seem to run small too. The angle didn't look too sharp in the picture but it definitely feels too sharp. This was my first time trying women's puma shoes do I didn’t really know what to expect and had to return these."
My 11 year old granddaughter loves these sneakers. They are stylish and Puma makes great athletic shoes. I bought two pairs.
Just as comfy as I was hoping they’d be and they look great! I’ve gotten compliments from guys and girls.
"I like the color schemes , cushions in soles"
They fit just right and look really nice
Shoes was dirty and it wasn’t what I was expected. Also it looks as though it was wore before and partially cleaned up with white shoe polish added. I am very disappointed!
Están muy bonitos pero si me gustaría que tuvieran más memory fom. Pero de allí estan muy bien. Muchas gracias. Sobre todo por qué soy una persona que tengo cancer y no he encontrados zapatos cómodos cerrados que me ayuden pues mis pies se fisuran la piel es muy delgada por eso me han gustado mucho la marca sketchers pues me acomodan muy bien a mis pies. Muchas gracias.
"Il venditore, leggendo quanto riportato nell'achivio di Amazon , non è colpevole come si vuol far credere.Deduzione logica tratta dagli scritti intercorsi."
ぴったりサイズでした。履きやすくて　良かった以前　同じタイプで　ブラックをはいてました。
I bought these for a family member who has real difficulty getting shoes to fit comfortably because of her disability. They're my favourite shoes and now they're also her favourite shoes they fit great she's able to walk better than usual.  I couldn't ask for a better pair of shoes for her.
I love these shoes.  I can wear them all day and my feet don’t hurt at the end of the day! I have five pair now.  And I can throw them in the washing machine when they get dirty.
"I bought this shoe for my mother who is in assisted living. These shoes are the most comfortable Sketchers I have ever had...so, I bought myself some too! LOL"
"Got these for my mom and she loves them, wears them everyday."
"Red shoes for a cause.  Great price, comfortable walking support, but narrow.  I wish they came in wide sizes."
These shoes are super-comfortable and I'm so happy with the color! Skechers never disappoints me.
Received my Skechers and they fit great
Son muy cómodos con la excelente calidad de Puma. Puestos se ven mejor que en las fotos.Solo que las tallas son 1/2 número mayores
"Considerando los comentarios pedí talla 23.5 siendo 24 en la mayoría de mis zapatos pero me llegó 23 :(. Me quedan un poco justos pero siento que los puedo usar así, pero definitivamente me hubieran quedado bien los 23.5.Fuera de eso me gustaron los tenis, son iguales a las imágenes y están muy bonitos."
Son justo como la descripción. Llegaron en perfecto estado. Som cómodos y ligeros.
Muy buen diseño. Recomendado.
"Muy bonitos y cómodos, pero muy amplio, tuve q ponerle plantilla por q me quedo un poco grande."
Muy cómodos
Muy buen producto excelente
"Ame los tenis son cómodos y el diseño super cool, llegó un día antes de lo esperado."
People admired and loved the runners . And so do I. I love it
Excelente calidad y precio
This is a beautiful shoe but the toe box is narrow.  I wear a regular in most shoes but Clark’s seem to run narrow for me.  Well worth the money if you know how they fit.
Great look and comfortable at the same time! Also light to walk for awhile.
"Nice shoe but...how has no one mentioned how small they are??? Son wears size 8. We ordered the 8, naturally. They were absurdly small. We sent them back, got 9’s. They too are crazy small. The Nike in the pic is a size 8, NB a size 9."
The quality is great but these run VERY small! I wear a 5.5 in women’s but went with a 6. Tried them on and within a few seconds couldn’t feel my toes because they’re so tight. I’ll need to go up to a 6.5 at least and that has never happened.
These were too narrow and tight even when going up one full size.
Impossible to get on since there is no tongue that opens up to put the fiitin easier.  We will be returning these.  Disappointed
Light
Runs a full size smaller than regular shoes.
"Scarpa molto comoda che non ha dato alcun problema a nostra figlia , nonostante il molto utilizzo. Buon materiale , esteticamente non mi hanno fatto impazzire ."
Sandali ben fatti e molto carini per l’estate! Adatti anche a chi ha un piede  magrolino! Vestono piccolo quindi ho dovuto prendere la misura più grande.
"Ottimo, comodo ed elegante. Li ho usati per le mie bimbe che hanno fatto da damigelle al mio matrimonio!"
Super Qualität. Wir sind sehr zufrieden.
Prendere taglia in più vestono piccolo !!
"De belles sandales, très confortables et réglables pour s’ajuster à la largeur du pied. Je recommande !"
fällt etwas klein aus
Prodotto perfetto.  Lo cercavo esattamente così!
Es wurde Zeit die dicken Winterschuhe zu entsorgen und bleibt man bei diesen Schuhen ist der Übergang bei trockenen Füssen. Sie sind leicht an- und auszuziehen und sehr schick. Wie immer bei Geox 1 Nummer grösser bestellen.
"EN GENERAL DE MALA CALIDAD, NO ES PIEL, ES SINTETICO Y HUELEN A PLASTOCO BARATOS, COMO LA ESTRENAMOS NO PUDIMOS DEVOLVERLAS"
"My daily footwear. Have held up really well, look good enough for loafers."
"PERFECT FIT, WORDS CANNOT EXPLAIN C"
"Good shoes, good price, speedy delivery.  Keep up the good work!"
Tres bonne qualité
"Most comfortable shoes I’ve ever bought, wish there were more in my size. Very good quality!"
Great !
"Been wearing this brand exclusively for 8+ years and I appreciate the comfort these shoes provide. The are sleek enough for formal meetings and casual enough for classroom teaching. I always look for the best price as Clark’s are expensive, which I why I got this pair - I usually get them at Clark’s. I wear these 5 days a week 10 hours a day and they last almost all year with only the sole wearing out. Note: I do maintain them weekly by cleaning and polishing which probably helps the lasting look and feel of the uppers."
"Not clarcks , it came in unsturctured brand boxEven clarcks not graved on shoes"
Used wardrobe to try on a few pairs of slip ons as I wear them for work. These are comfortable and fit just right. It was up between these or the hush puppies. Ultimately went with these to try and was not diappointed.
Excellent quality. Beautiful shoe.
Son preciosos pero tuve que devolverlos porque estaban grandes
"Dieser Stiefel würde sogar 1000% von mir bekommen. Ich habe gar nicht so viel erwartet, aufgrund des ausgesprochen günstigen Preises. Aber !!!! Er ist wunderschön. Passt perfekt, ist robust und wirklich sehr zu empfehlen. Ich habe sehr schmale Waden und hätte mir wahrscheinlich ein sondermaß anfertigen lassen müssen, aber wer schlank ist und auch schmale Waden hat, wird sich über diesen Stiefel wirklich freuen ."
"Dieser Reisstiefel sieht wirklich gut aus. Leider ist er an den Waden extrem schmal geschnitten. Ich habe diese Stiefel für meine 12jährige sehr schlanke Tochter bestellt. Selbst sie hat den Stiefel oben am Druckknopf nicht zu bekommen. Weil sie diese aber unbedingt wollte hat der Schumacher unseres Vertrauens den Druckknopf versetzt, so dass sie letztendlich rein passte."
"Sehr hoher Schaft, somit auch nicht passend für Kinder.Und leider viel zu klein. Ich bin 1.63 und wiege 57kg, also ganz normale Statur. Habe auch keine dicken Waden, dennoch habe ich die Stiefel gerade mal bis zur Achillessehne zu bekommen. Sie sehen wunderschön aus, sind aber nur was für wirklich sehr schlanke Beine! Artikel geht zurück. Ein Schein für den Kostenlosen rückversandt lag bei. Versuche jetzt nochmal die Stiefel in der kurzen/weiten Variante"
"Leider bin ich ziemlich enttäuscht. Für kleinere Kids vielleicht ok. Das das nicht echtes Leder ist, war mir ja schon vorher klar, aber das sind einfach Gummistiefel ! Anders kann ich es leider nicht beschreiben. An sich sehen sie ganz gut aus, aber am Fuß, nein tut mir leid. Wenn man läuft, sacken sie richtig ein. Unten breit und oben eng, dass der Knopf fast nicht zu ging. PS : Sind wie ich meine die gleichen wie die bei Krämer für 80 €. Also könnt ihr gerne nochmal dort vorbei gucken, so wie auf dem Bild hier sehen sie nämlich eher nicht aus. Schade !"
"J'ai acheté ces bottes début d'année et je pratique l'équitation de manière intensive (3 à 5 fois par semaine) et je les mets lorsque je veux nettoyer les boxes, c'est-à-dire tous les jours. Elles résistent bien d'autant plus que je ne les soigne pas non plus à chaque fois car je les utilise en tant que bottes de travail. Elles sont assez confortables cependant la tirette bloque légèrement au début mais cela s'améliore avec son utilisation au fil du temps. Il faut lui laisser le temps de se former à votre pied.Je suis ravie d'avoir trouvé des bottes parfaites pour les personnes de petite taille qui nécessitent une tige courte et un tour de mollet mince tout en ayant une pointure de taille 38.Je suis satisfaite de mon achat et je recommande ces bottes."
Compre unas botas de montar y las he devuelto porque eran grandes.No me ha gustado nada haber tenido que pagar 43€ de gastos de devolución en correos. Me parece alucinante y un auténtico robo.
"Ottimo prodotto, molto comodo, l'unica cosa è che alla caviglia restano appena abbondanti"
Super schöne Schuhe !!An manchen stellen drücken sie leider ein bissel am Anfang aber jetzt geht es !!Ich habe super tollen halt auf meinem Pferd und ich würde sie immer wieder kaufen !!
Dopo due tentativi sono finalmente riuscito ad individuare la taglia corretta. Ottimo prodotto consigliato.
Ottimo prodotto
"They are very soft, you can tell it's good quality. I'd say though that they look more sporty in real life than in the pictures. I bit like football shoes, if that makes sense:) Still happy with the quality and the material."
"Utilisées pour le Tai chi, la semelle caoutchouc amortit vraiment très bien, les chaussures accrochent bien au sol mais permettent aussi de glisser les pieds pour les mouvements qui le nécessitent.Très bonne qualité et confort.La couleur claire fait que je les porte plus à l'intérieur en salle, qu'à l'extérieur."
"die Schuhe sind schön warm, aber leider etwas klobig. Aber zum spazierengehen mit dem Hund ok."
Muy cómodas y calientitas
"Cute but the cut of these did not work for me, returned.  The insole was cushiony but the shape of the boot made it uncomfortable to walk in.  Also, the top of the boot has a large opening which is good for accommodating different sizes but it slides around unless you cinch it all the way with the laces which I think will crease the material over time and also just felt kind of weird.  I would like to see this concept redesigned since it is a cute style but just fits really strangely (sizing up or down wouldn't have helped) and did not feel very practical."
I was so DISAPPOINTED that these walking shoes would NOT allow me to slide my foot inside ! I'm 66 yrs old and walk my 82 lb dog twice a day.  These shoes looked like the perfect footwear for light snowfall days.  HAH. The opening at the top is too narrow and rigid.  There are no gussets that allow the opening to widen and accomodate your heel and ankle.  Very POOR design !  Because of that I cannot comment on the fit or comfort.  I had high hopes for these.  The tread on the bottom of the shoe and the ankle support would have made this a very stable shoe/boot.
"I really like these boots but I just wish they were a little bit more comfortable. I had to return my regular size and get a half size bigger because they definitely run small. I did keep the 7 1/2 because they are easy to wear and get around in in the city, but I find that my heel to slip out just a little bit even with my orthotics inside. I don’t think I would wear them every day but the days that I do with them they are pretty comfortable"
Looked nice-had to return too small
Could not get my foot all the way in the shoe. No side zipper or opening at the shoe laces to open up the shoe
I was unable to put my foot in the shoe. Returned immediately!!
Warm. Look good. However the soles make my ankles legs and knees bend in. I won’t be wearing them because of knee arthritis. Love new balance sneakers and was hoping these would be equally good.
Nice boots.
"Devo dire che esiste un rapporto di amore/odio con me e questo specifico marchioI prodotti sono eccellenti, la qualità costruttiva ottima ma, ogni volta che decido di acquistare qualcosa di questo marchio, finisco sempre per restituirlo.CONFEZIONE: bella e originale, completa di tutte le sue carte protettive sia interne che esterneMATERIALI E QUALITA’:All’interno troviamo le scarpe e li notiamo subito la qualità costruttiva e dei materiali. La pelle è fantastica le cuciture e sono impeccabili. All’interno della scarpa, sotto al tallone e sul lato interno, troviamo un piccolo “spessore” in gomma che permette al piede di non affaticarsiPREZZO: se prese con le giuste offerte, riuscite a risparmiare anche il 70% rispetto al negozio.L’unico diffeto di queste scarpe sono le taglie: CONTROLLATE BENE LE TAGLIE !!!!!!Come gia’ detto io le ho spedite indietro più volte, anche cambiando taglia ma non ho mai trovato quelle adatte a me. Inoltre le foto sono davvero fatte male e non consentono di capire bene lo stile della scarpa e come potrebbero stare ai propri piediCONCLUSIONI: Le consiglio come qualità costruttiva e dei materiali, ma non ho avuto il piacere di poterle indossare nemmeno 1 ora e provare il loro fantastico design e comodità"
The shoes were delivered in an ordinary unbranded box.. as if some local shopkeeper has send them.. the quality of shoes is bad and I doubt if it's pure leather material or else.. also not sure if it's original Clark's product..  I'm in two minds if should retain or return it.
"La misura è fedele a quella reale (forse la punta si allunga un po' più del solito, ma ritengo sia il modello).  Controllo Qualità da rivedere: non si assembla una scarpa quando la suola in gomma presenta bolle e dunque irregolarità che, soprattutto sulla punta di una scarpa classica, sono fastidiose da vedere."
"Ho comprato queste scarpe durante un'offerta ad prezzo speciale (20€).Le scarpe sono di buone qualità e si presentano bene. Forse mi aspettavo qualcosa in più a livello della qualità della pelle, ma per il prezzo sono davvero ottime. La misura corrisponde fedelmente a quella che porto di solito."
Che belle.. qualità buona e anche il colore molto bello la pelle certo si vede che non è la migliore ma a quel prezzo.. cmq sono meravigliosamente comode
Scarpe comode. La suola è fatta in un materiale che é impermeabile all acqua. Il numero corrisponde a quello reale.
"Molto comode, ottimo confort, cuscinetto morbido al plantare e al tallone, buonr finiture in pelle."
The shoe seemed like a cheap road side product.
"Forma molto bella, qualita' della pelle non è un granché morbida"
"Belle scarpe, ma quelle che sono arrivate a me avevano la suola deformata"
Molto belli e comodi
Schnelle Liefe und Preis auch i.O.rung
ces chaussures ne tiennent pas le piedla longueur est bonne mais impossible de serrer les lanières afin que le pied soit bien tenu
"Estaba especialmente feliz de recibir este modelo ya que como es importado espere varios días, y oh sorpresa! Talla equivocada! Es la segunda vez que me pasa en productos de importación:/... Lo tuve que regresar ! El modelo está súper bonito :("
"I do workout videos several times a week.  I like to make sure that my shoes can stand up to all the moves.  These shoes fit perfectly and are great to workout in.  I love the longer tongue on the shoes-I know that sounds funny, but they protect the ankle area more than most shoes do."
Comfy love it

Value for money
"Buen producto, muy cómodos, el material se ensucia con facilidad es como tipo gamuza. Quizás lo único sería que para mí vienen anchos los Tennis, puesto que son amplios de la punta. Pero en general están bonitos, me gustaron 🙂👟like like like"
Le scarpe che ho acquistato sono comodissime e di ottimo materiale
Le scarpe sono perfettamente corrispondenti alla descrizione e all'immagine della pagina di amazon.
"Great sneakers . look great, thank you"
"Why are athletic shoe companies putting these weird things under the soul? Is it supposed to be a gel pad or what? Instead of making the shoe more comfortable, it makes the shoe less comfortable. Please, just give us a nice smooth insole. . Don’t put these gel pads in there because they don’t work and we can feel them so it defeats the purpose.  If it’s not a gel pad I don’t know what it is. But it’s a horizontal lump going from left to right under the ball of the foot area. Also I don’t like the toe area, too pointy, prefer more rounded."
I was worried b/c multiple reviews said these run large and order down a size but I wear a 5 which is the smallest size. They fit fine though and feel nice
These are exactly as described. Reebok is the best!! I ordered an 8.5 and they fit perfectly
"This shoe is a knock off!!! The printed logo ""Reebok"" is supposed to be in the white part of the back area above ankle as seen in picture #1 above. Notice pic #2 doesn't have it. For $65 it's a rip-off"
"I wasn't sure if I would like these shoes because I couldn't find many written reviews. I've searched the internet for a nice comfy white sneaker to go with every outfit. I didn't want to spend a ton, definitely not over $100. I found these and prayed they would fit right, and not hurt my feet, and also look good. They are super cute, and fit very well. I've always been in between a 9 and 9 1/2, I never really know what size to get. I went for a 9 and they fit wonderfully. They are very comfortable , and I'm excited to wear them with every outfit and not ruin my feet!"
"These shoes are very light weight, softly cushioned and very comfortable for all day wear! I got a half size bigger just because but I think it’s okay to order true to size! Got a pair for my friend also, bought true to size and they fit her great! Easy to clean also, I just use a wet wipe after I get home for any marks or smudges."
"Taglia corrisponde, ho usate per una gita in citta' e devo dire che sono comode."
Ein sehr schicker und bequemer Schuh. Größe passt perfekt.
Schön und bequem
"Feder leicht und sehen einfach schick aus. Die Schuhe kann man mit allem kombinieren. Ich finde das Material etwas fester, es könnten unschöne Druckstellen/Blasen am Fuß oben entstehen. Und da der Schuh einen Lacküberzug hat, könnte ggf. und schöne Falten/Knickstellen entstehen. noch habe ich die Schuhe nicht ausgeführt und kann dazu nichts sagen, ist nur eine Vermutung. Da ich die Schuhe für ca. 32€ im Angebot gekauft habe, die schick aussehen, beim Probelauf zu Hause mega bequem und federleicht sind, hab ich die trotzdem behalten. Gebe jedoch auf Grund der oben aufgeführten Punkte insg. 4 Sterne. Ich hoffe ich war hilfreichNachtrag: nun hatte ich die Schuhe einen Tag lang an und habe wie befürchtet Blasen bekommen. Deshalb nur noch 2 Sterne von ursprünglich 4 Sterne. 1 Stern für das geringe Gewicht (federleicht) und 1 Stern für das Aussehen (sehen einfach super schön aus und die Farbe ist mega), jedoch bringt das alles nix wenn die Schuhe hinterher Blasen bescheren. Also keine Kaufempfehlung."
"Ein toller Schuh, leicht, passgenau, sehr bequem - und auch optisch sehr ansprechend. ich trage den Schuh nun ein paar Tage und bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Kauf."
"Sehr auffällig, chic mit dem Bugatti - Schriftzug"
Wie nach Maß. Laufen sich super und leicht.
Incredibly light weight and comfortable!!Nice quality and design!
Ich besitze schon einige Schuhe von Bugatti und bin wie immer sehr zufrieden!
Mein Wunsch erfüllt

Die Sneakers sind sehr schön und tolle Innensohle. Empfehlenswert 👍
"Very comfortable, recommended"
"Ich habe Gr. 37,5 und bestelle immer Gr. 38. Diese Schuhe passen mir in Gr. 37, sind wunderschön und bequem. Würde mir am liebsten noch mehr Farben bestellen ;DNachtrag: Meine Kollegin und ich haben noch mal zugeschlagen. Sie hat einen breiteren Fuß (Gr. 37) und hat daher die Gr. 38 genommen. Wunderschöne Farben und sehr gute Verarbeitung."
"Ganz tolle und bequeme Stiefelchen mit beidseitigen Reißverschluss, das erleichtert das Hinschlüpfen sehr."
"Ein wunderschöner Sommer Schuh. Sieht original noch besser aus, als auf den Bildern. Bin sehr zufrieden. 👍"
Schöner bequemer Schuh ich trage Größe 37 und hab viel Platz. Einziger Kritikpunkt der Schaft ist etwas weit .
Artikel gefällt mir gut. Genauso wie in der Beschreibung.  Pünktlich Lieferung
Sehr schön!
"Awsome, comfortable light shoes."
"Wanted to buy this product for both casual and slightly smart casual wear, but the material isn't really good for smart casual wear, so it sort of defeated my purpose for buying it. The Men's Street Encounter series are much better, and the material used also more formal and suitable for smart casual wear. Shoes are overall quite light and easy to wear, but it simply didn't fit my purposes. Would recommend for casual wear though!"
"Too too small. I have wide feet, but I even had my daughter and granddaughter try them who wear a size 8, they both said they fit like a 6."
"Light and comfortable, love them."
"Le ho prese per la mia bimba di 11 mesi che già cammina, le stanno perfette. Molto flessibili, comode da indossare. Anche per il grande ho preso delle Puma, le ritengo le migliori, soprattutto in qualità/prezzo"
Qualità/prezzo. Sono carine e corrispondono al proprio numero.
J adore.. tout à fait ce que je voulais pour la rentrée de ma fille.. je recommande vivement ces chaussures!!
"I lacci sono elastici e tendono ad allentarsi ma mi sembra una buona scarpa, che sostiene la caviglia, adatta anche a chi ha bisogno di inserire i plantari"
"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Non e colore quello  che  lo  prenotato  io"
El zapato se rompió muy pronto tiene un par de días de uso por lo que no recomiendo comprar este producto
Producto sobrepaso las expectativas.. 100% recomendado
"These are a little fancier than I would send my kid to school in.They are more like a fancy occasion, Sunday church, holiday, or just an “I can’t find my sneakers” day (it happens).I was anxious about the “slip on” as sometimes this style is actually harder to get on kid’s limp feet as they don’t tend to push their foot in to help you out at all when trying to get the shoes on. I was surprised that my kid could actually get these on all by himself and without any socks to ease the way to boot. I’m pleased that the elastic panels built in actually stretch enough so the kids can get their foot in.The quality of these is really good. They look and feel like a high quality men’s shoe, just in a mini me, kid’s size. This is a great shoe to match Dad in.My kid was so excited about his new shoes he ran errands around town in them the day he got them.Can’t wait for him to wear these to picture day, etc.Overall I’d recommend them."
"Pros:1. They work well for almost any occasion.2. Comfortable, my son has no complaints and gives them a big thumbs up3. They look very nice in person, very happy with the style.Cons:1. They are showing very slight signs of wear after a month but to be fair my child is very active.2. The materials used for these shoes aren’t bad but also not high grade either.Overall these are a great pair of shoes. There is a little room for improvement but overall I’m happy with them and i would definitely get them again."
"I love that these have the utility of a sneaker but can slip on easily without my child needing to tie the shoes or mess with velcro straps!  Very well made, durable child shoe.  My child feels comfortable in them and has never complained about wearing them (he would be barefoot all the time if that were an option). They dry faster than most of his other shoes---which is helpful because he refuses to put on a wet shoe-and I don't blame him!.  Worth the extra expense for its functionality and ease of putting on."
"My 6 year old likes these.  They're comfortable and easy to slip on, they have good stretch to fit over his foot. They're lightweight, too.They appear to be a well-made and attractive shoe.  No loose threads or wonky stitching.  They're cute for summer with a pair of shorts, but they would dress up nicely with a pair of khakis.I'm very happy with these, I would definitely recommend."
"I like these shoes a lot. I got them for my son he needs a little more growing to do though i like to get them big so he can used them as much as possible. They are very soft on the inside, lots of cushion for the back of the heal. I can tell they are well made with hight quality materials and are flexible, slip resistance for outdoor activities all day long."
"Genuine leather is always a plus for any kind of shoes, they're so much more durable. These are of a high enough quality that we will easily be able to pass them on to our youngest when our older son is done with them. Easy to slip on and off, and the elastic at the shoe's opening helps with wider feet. Looks great with jeans and little boy khaki pants."
"I like the look of these shoes, and they seem to be high quality. I think they're a great casual look -  nicer than sneakers without being too formal or grown-up. My son says they're one of the most comfortable pairs he's ever owned. Both of us enjoy the ease of them being slip-on."
"My 7-year-old loves these shoes. They are casual enough for everyday wear, but also nice enough when he needs to dress up a bit. They fit and feel like sneakers, but look like loafers. Great shoes for an active little guy."
Schuhe wurden schnell geliefert. Leider waren rote Einfärbungen auf dem Stoff.Daher habe ich die Schuhe gleich wieder zurückgeschickt.
"Everyone has Birkenstocks and I wanted something a little different, and I love Sorel shoes, so I gave these a try.  They are super comfortable and cute, though I have wide feet and this style is not flattering to my specific feet.  But I don't care.  We are living through a pandemic and I want comfort.  And I can see beyond the ugliness of my feet to appreciate the beauty of these shoes.  Highly recommend!  Fit true to size."
Great shoes! The quality is high! But Produkt is too large!!!The size indicated on the package 44.5 (31 cm) will suit you if your foot size is 46.
"Didn’t like them as much at first. Gave me bad blisters, kind of slid off, almost returned them. But now I wear them all of the time! Great support."
I bought these as a gift and the person I got them for loves them. She says they fit perfectly according to her size and are sturdy. Of course they're sturdy; they're Sorels!
Size up 1/2 size. 9 fits just like 8 1/2. Very cute and comfy. Leather will stretch a bit. Very happy with this Sorel purchase!
"Comfortable, TTS, good quality."
"Attractive, good sale price and comfy"
"Per ben due volte ho dovuto restituire l'articolo. Ordinato il n. 42, ma è arrivato il 41. Per la prima restituzione col cambio articolo ho parlato anche con un'operatrice amazon per essere sicuro mi venisse sostituito con la taglia giusta, ma nulla da fare,  la sostituzione è stata fatta sempre con taglia errata."
The sandal did not grip my foot. I had a difficult time walking in them. Had to return.
"Muy buena pinta, suela blandita, pero demasiado pequeño. Talo 41, compré 41 y es pequeño, lo devuelvo."
Desastre total. No tienen ni dos meses y apenas los he usado y ya están despegados o rotos por el talón.
Belle e comode mio figlio ne è soddisfatto
Ottime Sneakers calzano bene e la suola interna è molto comodo
Preciosos
"Ordinato 42.5. Ricevuto 41.Pero lo stile, colore e qualità sono top. Per questo due e non solo una stella."
bellissime scarpe davvero comoda e molto minimal stile element nice
Excelente producto
"Las zapatillas son muy bonitas, pero es la segunda vez que intento comprarlas y se equivocan con la talla."
These may fit if I hope on to them in two or three years. I was really shocked at the size.  They were like 5 inches to long.  I had ordered one size up so went to different company ordered the size and is 12 and perfect fit. Little roomy and perfect. Will be sending them back if I don't miss window. I was just shocked how huge.  I should have read the comments. My little one cried and cried.  They folded when she tried to walk in them.  It was like watching her walk in my shoes
"I bought these for our grandaughter she wears them all the time.  The boots are super cute and of high quality. They are  not a  cheap build like most I have seen at our local target stores. Well worth the money, especially if you have another younger  child who can wear  them after their sibling is done with them."
Beautiful boots but be aware they are very heavy.  I bought them for my two year old granddaughter.  She can barely lift them.  A larger size for older kids would probably be ok... like a 5 year old might be able to handle them in their size.  But not ideal for toddlers.
My 2 yr old granddaughter absolutely loves these boots. These are the only shoes she wants to wear. She can put them on and take them off by herself. They are well made. Easy to keep clean. You just wipe them off.
My toddler is really a 5- but I wanted her to be able to put these on and off herself- so I expected them to be big and they were! She loves them and has been wearing them around the house. It’s raining today so it should be interesting to see how she likes them outside!
"My daughter loves these.  They are a bit larger than expected which is fine. Gives her room to grow. We live in Phoenix so it doesn't rain often, but she's thrilled to run and jump in muddy puddles and not ruin her good shoes."
My daughter loves these!! These are perfect for little guys to pull on with the handles. We bought a coat and umbrella to match as well! Cant wait to jump in puddles!
They run a little big but they are really cute my niece wears a size ten in toddler and these boots in size ten slipped right on and off her foot making it kinda hard for her to walk because of the looseness
"These boots were a Christmas gift for my 2  year old granddaughter . She wears a size 8 and these were roomy, however, she walks fine in them. VERY cute boots and she loves them! Theses boots have been worn ALOT since Christmas and still look super cute after being cleaned."
My granddaughter loved these rain boots! She’s three and loves Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Perfect gift.
"Klare Kaufempfehlung, passt, sitzt und hat Luft ! Sehr bequem, man hat das Gefühl barfuß zu laufen."
"These shoes were perfect!  I got mine as a Christmas present and am so happy with them. They do run slightly larger than your actual size, so size down a half size. These are authentic because I keep seeing people asking. The ones with the serial numbers on them, that's the style of those ones. For some reason Adidas decided to leave those like that. You can look at the actual Adidas website and you can cross reference those specific colors/styles and you will see that they have serial numbers on them from the actual website as well.  These shoes are some of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn, they are the best!"
"I forgot to write a review on this item, however I got these a couple months ago for my sister and she loved them. Not only did she say they were comfortable but they are also very stylish. They fit her nice and she loved them"
i got 10.5 like i always do with adidas shoes but had to return for the 10 and its still semi too large.  Not the most comfortable but they do look nice.  Probably won't work out in these as i expected to be able to due to that.
I know these shoes run large buy a .5 size down ! I get lots of compliments on these
These are beautiful! I have one other pair in this style so I know they run large. I recommend sizing down one size. I'm normally a size 8 in womens but these i ordered a 7 and they fit perfect. Lightweight and comfortable. Love the color!
absolutely love these. didn’t want to pay full price for these shoes and they are perfect
The shoes were a gift and they loved it! Perfect gift.
Cute and functional all in one !! Recommend !!
Run a little big. Go half a size down.
"Las zapatillas vienen en caja original con logo de CONVERSE. Todo parece correcto, por lo menos parece piel y tallaje grande como es habitual en esta marca. Yo suelo usar 39-40 EU en general (mi pie mide 26 cm. y es ancho) y aquí me pedí 38,5 y aún me sobra quizás algo más incluso llevando calcetín (no media). El modelo es JUNIOR. No es ni de hombre ni de mujer. Pero si tienes pie que no pasas del 40 EU habitual puedes optar por comprar zapatillas de modelo JUNIOR. El tallaje que viene es 6 USA - 38,5 EU - 24 cm. En las Chuck Taylor de mujer uso 7,5 USA -38 EU - 24 cm. Me guie por la medida de cm. para ver si acertaba y parece ser que sí."
"Tengo zapatillas converse. Siempre son la misma talla. Hoy he recibido estas, y son tremendamente grandes. He pensado en ponerme una plantilla. Aún así, tallan muy grandes...nada que ver con las converse que he comprado en zapaterías. El lunes las devolveré. Además vienen en una caja de cartón marrón sin ninguna identificación, ni de marca ni de número ni de nada....cuando lo normal seria que vinieran en su caja original. Lo dicho...el lunes las devuelvo...mal por todos lados."
"Bellissime e comode, specialmente per la mezza stagione. La tomaia in pelle è leggera ma non fa sfreddare i piedi. La suola è platform. Solitamente calzo un 38, ho preso un 37.5( ben sapendo che le Converse calzano grande rispetto a marchi come Nike ad esempio) ma sarebbe andato benissimo anche un 37 perché ha una calzata a pianta larga. Prezzo decisamente ottimo"
"Scarpe ottime, sia esteticamente che come prezzo, ho acquistato come mio solito il 36,avevo già altri modelli di converse e mi sono sempre trovata bene con il numero che porto di solito, queste risultano leggermente più grandi forse mezzo numero"
"Ottima qualità, il prodotto rispetta le caratteristiche indicate;giuste le misure che corrispondono al numero che solitamente calzo....un particolare ringraziamento va al venditore che si è dimostrato disponibile sin da subito a soddisfare la mia esigenza, professionale e molto cortese!!"
Genial. Tal cual la foto. La persona a la que se le ha regalado feliz. Dice son cómodas. Lleva con ellos dos días. Esperemos den buen resultado.
"Genial!!! Llegaron antes de la fecha estimada.Han venido con su caja y son súper cómodas, eso sí, como ya leí que calzaban grandes cogí una talla menos y son las mías!!!"
"Tutto sommato sono belle, peccato siano enormi. Prendete 1 taglia in meno"
Todo bien
Pedi medio numero mas q mi numero habitual y queda como 1 talla mas grande
"Las sandalisa están muy padres, son de buen material, muy ligero y comodo, la calidad de siempre de New balance.Ojo, no cometas el mismo error que yo, pidelas de tu número, yo las pedi un numero más grande y no era necesario, vienen muy amplias."
"Country of origin:  These sandals are made in VietnamFinish:  These appear to be injection molded, so even though they might ultimately crack/tear, but they should be somewhat more reliable than the glued ones.Fit:  Very narrow width, extremely tight. My shoe size is 10.5, Medium width for my New Balance 990 series. Since these sandals do NOT come in half sizes, I ordered these New Balance sandals in Size 11, Medium width. Result?  Very NARROW WIDTH, and the fit is extremely tight and uncomfortable. Pretty disappointing. Not sure what size chart they used when manufacturing these, but it surely isn't the same chart for fitting the NB 990 series.Conclusion:  If you are going to order these, might want to keep the caveat about narrow width in consideration."
"They're sandals - not much else to say. The fit and color are as advertised. Decent value for money if bought on sale, although I probably wouldn't pay full price for them."
"These are great sandles . bout them for running out to the hot tub, they seem good and durable . should last for years"
Aprietan un poco
"La caja vino algo aplastada pero es lo de menos, lls zapatos estaban sin detalles, me quedaron perfectamente.Los uso para entrenar box todos los días y si son duraderos"
Great quality and amazing comfortable
"Cómodos, super diseño"
100% satisfied
"After 1 match, going all 3 min, it is loosing the color coating on the toe of the shoe. The black part is coming off and the red is showing through...just 1 Match!  This I am very disappointed about. Bought my son the solid black ones last season and they did great. That is what ultimately made me decide to purchase these this season for him. However, for $107.00 I expected to get a solid shoe that would take wear better than 1 match."
My daughter got almost two seasons of wear out of these shoes. We just bought another pair in a different color because the first pair is starting to wear out. We feel this is a very acceptable amount of use. She loves the way they feel. Her women's shoes size is 7.5-8 and she wears a 6.5 in the Mat Wizard 4.
"Had to return these. The started falling apart after four days of practice. The tongue came completely off on one shoe and the toe stitching came apart on both shoes. We have had kids wrestling for 10 years and have never had a pair of wrestling shoes that did not make it through one season. These did not make it through 4 days, which was a shame. The shoes felt good, and provided good traction on the mat."
"Initially I was submitting a better review, but i cannot honestly say they're as good as we'd like. My son wears these for training and competitions. He said they're pretty comfortable, but he's only had them for seven weeks, and they're looking ugly. They're peeling and starting to come apart. I really hoped because they were Adidas brand, they would be better quality. Now I feel embarrassed for him when he has to show up at a Tournament and the shoes look like he's had them for ages."
"Not very wide and comfortable compared to size 12 asics with medium thickness wool socks.As One is cloth and the other is some newer molded stuff.I wear thinner wool socks and fit snug. Can wear all day, during gym and errands, comfortably.Really grippy.  Just wish I could wear my normal wool socks."
True to size. Very comfortable. I use the at the gym for cardio and working the heavy bag. Quality is solid. One downside is that they’re not very breathable as my feet sweat in these shoes a lot.
Ottimo prodotto
Fit exactly as expected.  My high school son loves them and was able to wear them right out of the box.  Highly recommend.
"Sleek shoe. It's a perfect fit for my son. Very light shoe; when my son outgrows it, we'll buy another just like it."
This is a great starter spike. My son loves the feel how lightweight it is.
great shoes!
Great pair of track shoes. They held up for the season and then some. Would definitely buy again.
Lovem!!!
"Nachdem ich in allen Schuh- und Sportgeschäften nach Badeschuhen gesucht habe und alle im Spann viel zu niedrig waren sind wir auf diese Schuhe gestossen. Wir haben sie 3 Wochen in Bachläufen Korsikas getestet und für gut befunden. Man kommt super leicht rein, durch die Schnur kann man ihn passend machen und bequem waren sie auch.Allerdings muss man sie wirklich - wie schon beschrieben - mind. eine Nummer kleiner nehmen. Ich trage eine klassische 39 und habe sie in 38 bestellt und für meinen Sohn auch 1 Nummer kleiner. Daumen hoch!"
"Die Schuhe sind hochwertig verarbeitet und laut meinem Sohn auch sehr bequem.Diese Badeschuhe fallen zwar größer aus, aber mit dem Zugband lässt sich der Schuh noch einstellen. Habe zwar gelesen, dass man eine Größe kleiner bestellen sollte, aber nachdem die Kinder schneller wachsen als der Schnittlauch im Garten, wollte ich doch, dass die Schuhe etwas länger halten. Zudem sollten Sie nicht ZU eng sein, wenn die Kinder rumlaufen und durch Hitze und Wasser die Füße etwas ""größer werden"".Nächste Woche werden die Schuhe dann dem Härtetest (heißer Sand und Wellenspringen) unterzogen :)"
"Mir waren die Badeschuhe besonders wichtig, da wir da in Urlaub waren wo es nicht nur super weichen Sand gibt, sondern auch Steine und gegebenenfalls auch die kleinen Fische auf die man nicht treten sollte.Die Schuhe sind schnell an und auch wieder ausgezogen und auch leicht mit Süßwasser wieder ausgespült.Würde ich immer wieder kaufen."
"Sieht gut aus, passt gut, preis ist auch ok. Deutlich weniger rutschen im Schwimmbad . Leider aber nach dem ersten tragen schon kaputt gegangen. Der Riemen zum verstellen ist abgerissen."
"Standard Schuhe, die ich auch woanders bekomme. Aber die Qualität ist gut, nur das reingehen mit den Füßen nervt."
"Größe passt, Qualität top"
"Mein Sohn hat Größe 31, die bestellte Größe. Leider fällt der Schuh derart groß aus, dass er den Badeschuh im Wasser vermutlich verlieren würde. Dass ich jetzt die Kosten der Rücksendung (immerhin 1/3 des Kaufpreises) zu tragen habe, ist ärgerlich."
"6 Jähriger möchte in Kroatien Steinstrand Badeschuhe anziehen, direkt gerissen :-("
Gut
"Die Schuh ist schon sehr bequem und stabilFür Felsen überhaupt kein Problem, gut gepolstertIch würde das hier weiter empfehlen"
"I have worn many running shoes for my feet. From walking to trail to running, and I use this for everyday shoes too. As a past New Balance wearer, I did change brands to a different competitor but, I welcome the opportunity to come back to New Balance. The Men's VENTR V1 Running Shoes slipped on like a glove! Silky, sleek and fits like a glove. Pampered my feet. I wore the shoes around the house to get a good feel for it. And one will know if the shoes will work within minutes. I wore the shoes for about a day, with no tiredness feet. It felt that I wasn't wearing any shoes! Sure, am wearing in the house, and it hasn't seen the outside terrain, but I do highly recommend New Balance VENTR V1 Running Shoes to anyone looking for shoes that gives them the arch support, great comforts for your feet and the price point to boot!"
"Los compre para reemplazar mis ya viejos tenis de ejercicio (Cardio , estatico) , la medida que pedi fue la adecuada , son muy comodos y acolchonados , mi ejercicio lo realizo sin problemas sin causar molestia o cansansio extra en la planta del pie , tambien los he utilizado para caminar distancias largas y son super comodos para esto , el precio fue una ganga cuando los compre. El unico ojo es que hay que tener cuidado con la talla a adquirir."
"Not the best ""surprise"" feat to try and pull off, but I ended up buying these for my partner's bday present. He was shocked that I bought him running shoes, but upon first 'look' at them, his eyes brightly widened!These NB fit perfect-to-size, have been performing very-well for him as a light to moderate runner, and the look/feel of this shoe, is sleek and versatile.I try to wait a while prior to reviewing a purchase, and so far, approximately six-weeks in, he is raving about this shoe's performance, feel, and look. Very sexy and comfortable shoe for running or dressing up jeans during the day or night!*I wouldn't, however, buy this shoe today, at the price I see listed. A whopping CA$120 more than what I paid! Nuts!*"
After reading reviews a lot of people indicated the shoe fit smaller than it actually was and to be safe I ordered 1/2 larger . To be honest it was a big mistake the shoe to to larger :) It would have been nice to actually get the proper size .
"Cómodos, resistentes, se ven y se sienten de calidad, muy contento con la compra , también los agarré en un excelente precio"
I have been using brooks and i am fine while walking long distances. I tried these new balance shoes and feet started aching. Will wear for another day and will change my review if its fine.  Shoes look good
La talla se ajusta a mi tamaño de pie. No tengo problema alguno con ellos. Me encantaron y considero que fue buena compra ya que lo agarre de oferta.
"Relación calidad precio están muy bien, son tenis básicos pero bien hechos!"
"Llegaron a tiempo.  Excelentes, justo lo que estaba esperando.  Muy comfortables y se adaptan perfectamente al pie.  Sin embargo, hay que agregar media talla más ya que si no quedan muy justos."
"Super cómodos. Muy a gusto, la calidad de lo mejor. En pocas palabras super contento con el producto, por suerte los compre a un precio alrededor de 650 pesos."
"These things are great I have been using water shoes for years for cycling ,kayaking and the gym ,they are also nice to drive in ,if you can't decide on a colour do as I did and get the pair with all of them 😊 most arrive smelling like a chemical factory however these do not ! My feet love them and they fit wonderfully ."
"Very disappointed. They fit properly, however the toe part tore on the very first day of wearing them to an indoor waterpark. My big toe was sticking out after getting out of the wave pool. What a waste of money!! I can't wear these anymore."
They don't fit snug for use in the water. The material looks nice and well made and they are cute. Will look into getting a smaller pair.
"Love these! Fit perfectly and have a great sole. They are good enough to wear around the pool deck to protect my feet from the heat, and inside the pool, my feet don’t get torn up from the bottom of the pool (its a public pool, so I feel it’s more sanitary too).I take water aerobics and they’re so comfortable, I forget I have them on. Love them!"
"Awesome little water shoes, wore them camping wear ae were in and out of water, swimming, kayaking,  tubing. Most water shoes give me blisters,  these didnt, and I wore them for 5 days. Threw them in wash when I got home,  air dried, good as new. They run alittle tight but loosen up as you wear them! Well worth the price!"
Overall no complaints. Bought to go river rafting. Had no issues with them slipping off and didn’t feel the roughness of the rocks. We only did class 3 and below.The sizes are a little tricky I would buy a size down to make sure they don’t slip off.
These things are great!. With the price I thought maybe last 1 or 2 times on the river.Nope I crashed 3 times first trip. Kept my feet safe from rocks and when standing on rocks and mud my feet were secure and less muddy. I've used them every time I go kayaking. They are a must!!!!!
"I bought a pair for myself and for my husband. They are great. Three slip-on hugs the foot very well, and there is enough sole that protected the foot from broken sea shells while walking on the beach."
They are the best I have 5 pair I even have my husband wearing them he also loves them they are so comfortably can be warn with anything they are great
"Looked nice when they came, but after two or three times in the pool they are coming apart. I suppose these kinds of swim socks are good for light use; they didn't hold up to active swimming and playing in the pool. I was refunded."
My two-year-old grandson loves them doesn't want to take them off easy for him to put on and take off himself so that makes him feel awesome can I put a 3/4 warm because their summer sandals they're not warm sandals but we really really love them they're cute as can be
Very cute.
Die Schuhe sind einfach top. Mega leicht und sehr bequem und sehen klasse aus. Allerdings sind sie für einen schmalen Fuß gedacht.
Gute Qualität sauber verarbeitet.
"ich bin superglücklich!! sie sind viel schöner als auf Fotos, super bequem... demnächst bestelle ich mehr für die Familie"
Sehr gut 👍
Absolut toller Sneaker
"Gute Passform, sehr leicht."
"Loved the color, loved the look and style of the sneaker, but they tend to run narrow and short in toe-box.  So, order at least 1/2 size up for best fit"
This is my third pair. Love them !
"Pues confunde mucho la descripción y el nombre. Hydrotrekker, ¿por qué? Porque vas mojado como una hidra, porque el empeine es de malla. Vamos que las he devuelto."
Le scarpe sono perfette per nuotare e poi arrampicarsi sugli scogli: hanno un ottima presa. Però la suola si è rovinata molto in fretta (le ho usate su rocce di granito)
"contenta con la compra , rápido el envío , más bonitos en persona y lo mejor , son super cómodos"
"Gracias, estou encantada"
There was a hole the mesh
"UPDATE: I unfortunately had to reduce my review by 2 stars. After just a few hikes, the soles are falling apart. It’s a shame because I really loved these shoes.These were sooooo comfortable right out of the box. I get good traction and they handle getting wet very well. They’re pretty cute too!I should also mention that I typically wear an 8, and although the front of my foot is a normal width, my heels are very narrow; these shoes fit me very well in a 7 ½."
"These worked great for my recent trip to Zion National Park for hiking through the Narrows.  The shoe is comfortable and drains well.  I did size down a half size but otherwise fit well.  The shoes did take awhile to dry even though they drained well.  They were comfortable to wear, even without socks but did not offer much arch support.  If I were to wear them when not hiking through water I would need to add a shoe insert to provide arch support.  Overall worked great for what I needed them for and I will wear them again when hiking through rivers or tubing."
"Superschöne Schuhe, am Anfang wirkten sie etwas eng, aber nach kurzer Gehzeit, waren sie perfekt!Ich trage normalerweise Größe 37 und das sind 37er, aber ich nehme ab nun an 1 Größe größer.Bei allen Minnetonka-Schuhen hätte ich lieber 1 Größe größer nehmen sollen und werde sie auch in Zukunft größer bestellen.Bei diesen Schuhen geht es nach einer kurzen Gehzeit(ca.1 Stunde) aber super in 37.Vielleicht sollte man sie gleich eine Größe größer nehmen?Ich finde diese Marke großartig!Das Leder ist super schön und weich. Die Schuhe sind toll verarbeitet und ein Hingucker."
"This is the perfect shoe for walking and moderate hiking--light enough to wear everyday and rugged enough for rocky and wet trails.  Just toss them in the wash when needed.  This summer I landscaped my hilly, and in places very muddy backyard in these shoes.  They held up and still look great."
"LOVE the look and color of these shoes and, in general, love Minnetonka products. I ordered my normal size, 8 1/2, and couldn't even get my heel in the shoe. So I ordered a size 9. Though I could get my foot in the shoes, they were so narrow they hurt. This is the first product I've bought from Minnetonka that was so narrow. All their other shoes have run true to the width indicated. If you have narrower feet, these are for you! (My office mate loved them and now they're hers!)I'm sorry they didn't fit me as they are really good looking shoes."
They are soooo comfy and great in the water! I love a shoe that you can hike and go in and out of creeks and waterfalls with out constantly changing she’s!
"This shoe is awfully heavy and seems to have no room inside.  I had to really  struggle to get my foot inside a shoe a half size larger than what I generally wear.  It was quite uncomfortable.  Since I purchased it at a much reduced price and it seems to be well constructed, I am sending the pair on to the thrift store.  It is my hope that the shoes may actually fit someone who really needs a new pair.  This is the first time I have been dissatisfied with Minnetonka shoes."
"I ordered a pair. Says ""men"" on listing so ordered smaller to fit woman size.  Shipped a women's shoe at that size. Too small.  I reordered 3 pairs with Women sizes because I was going on a trip and needed them.  Checked cart. Said ""Merrell womens J033884 HYDROTREKKER SYN SHANDAL, Brindle, 9 US"" plus 2 other sizes/color.  Great! Correct sizes I thought.  Order arrived  with Womens  5.5, 6, 6.5.  NOT AT ALL WHAT I ORDERED.Now I have 4 pair to return. None of which is what I ordered."
First time I have ever had a shoe in my size that has run too small. Great looking shoe though.
I love these so much I sent a pair to my daughter...They are comfortable and cute...LOVE THEM
The shoe is comfortable a d easy to get into. Love the color too?
These shoes fit length wise just fine. But the toe area was too constricting. I have pretty narrow feet myself but these just felt like there was not enough height as well as width in the toe.
Nice sneaker! Fits great and comfortable!
"Great color, style and comfort! I would definitely purchase these again."
Most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn. I wore them for less than two hours. The heal dug into two spots on my heals and caused huge blisters. The toe area also rubbed the skin off several toes. It was a week before I could wear closed shoes again.
Super schöner Schuh. Leider fehlten uns ein paar Dornen
"I like this running shoe.  I ran a virtual 10K road race and ran a pretty good time in them.  However, the metal spikes needed to be replaced after one 10K road race.  You should only run in this shoe on a Track (rubber or synthetic).  I wish the manufacturer would have specified that in that I nearly destroyed the shoe running on concrete and streets.  There is plastic grip teeth that were ruined.  Also, if you are a distance runner buy lots of metal spikes, the spikes will wear after run like a 10K.  Oh yeah running in the rain no problem, the shoe itself does not absorb water like trainers, but your feet will get wet.  For the price I paid, under $40.00 not a bad purchase.  I am going to buy another pair."
"My daughter loves these shoes! She is a sprinter in track and said these really helped step up her game. Her only complaint is she wishes the laces were longer! She struggles to tie them, she can’t double knot it! So during her 200 run they came untied and she placed 4th because of it!"
"This is an awesome shoe but the sizes run small.  I may have converted the sizes incorrectly.  But since they are sold in mens sizes, I purchased a 6.5M to get a 8.5W.  Although we were a little disappointed, we were able to return the shoe, at no cost, for the correct size!"
These are great track sneakers. My daughter has requested the same pair for the second year. Spikes are easy to put in and take out. Very lightweight.
I wish that this shoe came with extra spikes. Had to go buy spikes immediately.
I had bought these for my daughter & tried to diff sizes but she said they were uncomfortable. She's flat footed & needs wide shoes so I believe that might be what the problem was. Too narrow for her feet.
As with most spikes they tend to run small. These fit better for our runner than the Saucony style.
Bought a pair for my 12yr old daughter. She loves them. She has set two personal bests wearing them.
Good spikes.
"Exact product, great price, quite ship. Highly recommended."
"I liked these shoes at first. I liked the simple look and the comfort. But, the first time I wore them in actually rain, my feet got wet! Really bummed because I’ve missed the return window now."
"sehr gutes Material, ideal zum wandern und outdoor"
These are great shoes. My review reflects the fit as tighter than others of the same size but different brand. I would recommend going at least 1/2 size up
Runs small wide is very narrow
I have very large feet. I bought the largest size and they actually fit very well. I love walking in Skechers Because I have neuropathy in my feet and they help me keep going all day long.
"La verdad no esperaba que quedaran tambien, el acoginamiento en el tendón de la parte trasera del pie lo hace un zapato muy comodo. Lo recomiendo para gente que gusta de zapatos que no le molesten en ninguna parte del pie y que les encante la comodidad. El mateiral como de gamusa a lo mejor dificulta un poco su limpieza, pero en relación con al comodidad que representan es un detalle insignificante"
Excellent
comfortable
Bonne qualité
Great shoes
The shoes are very comfortable.
"These are seriously one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned.  First pair of Skechers and I'm in love.  I have wide feet and my left foot is half a size bigger than my right, so I usually can't just buy shoes without trying them first.  I intended these to be personal shoes to use when I go out of the house with the family but don't want to wear running shoes.  But I've found myself bringing them to work because they look very professional and at the same time feel very comfortable.  I get about 12,000 steps a day when I'm at work so these have been amazing feet savers.  I even used them to teach a dance class and forgot that I wasn't wearing my dance shoes because they didn't stick to the wooden floors like basketball shoes yet have much more comfort than formal dance shoes.  I'm definitely getting another pair."
"I'm glad I took another reviewers advice and ordered a half size larger than what I normally wear.  My sneaker size is 9.5 but I ordered a 10 in this shoe and it fits just right.  The memory foam is perfect as I work in a retail environment and am on my feet many hours a day.  The casual loafer style also fits my work environment. I am very happy I made the decision to purchase this pair of shoes and will probably buy more in different colors. The price here can't be beat. I purchased another set of ""memory foam"" loafers at a local payless chain and for $10 more than what I paid for these Sketchers they are not even close in comfort. Highly recommend these."
"These are exceptionally comfortable loafers. They are very light and they have the very comfortable memory foam insole. I have a relatively high instep, so loafers do not always work well for me. These are surprisingly comfortable. Oddly enough, they are more comfortable to walk around in than they are to wear while sitting (high instep thing ... I guess). The material seems to breath better, my feet to not get as hot as they would with other shoes. The quality of the materials and of the construction is top notch. I may even buy another pair in a different color."
Super comfortable. Easy on and off. I can walk miles at a time and feet fell fine. I bought these for a exact replacement of my very worn pair should they ever wear out. I later bought another pair because my old ones were very worn. This last pair is exactly the same and beyond great for walking and comfort. Easy to put on and off is a great feature also.
"I’m searching for a cute yet quality shoe for a trip to Barcelona in fall.  This shoe was almost perfect.  Its really very pretty (I got the wine color).  It’s very comfortable, and the material has a lot of stretch and give— comfortable out of the box.  The only uncomfortable part was that my big toe rubbed on the top of the shoe.  Not the end— they were the right size— but the top, which bothered me while I walked.  If you’re thinking about these, definitely give them a try though."
I really want to love these but the support isn't there. I wish there was a Chaco support lightweight type of running shows. It still feels light. It's like putting you foot in paper. That's how light it is. I have flat feet so it does hurt to walk in these. Still very cute.
"I've loved chacos sandals for several years. I was thrilled to find out they carried regular shoes when my work pair were coming to the end of their life. I work on my feet and my fitbit reports between 7,000 and 10,000 steps a day. These have been great. They have the arch support I've come to expect with chacos and are as lightweight as my off duty slide on sketchers. As long as they turn out to be as durable as my sandals these will be a phenomenal purchase."
The only thing I dislike is that the padding on the upper part of the back of the shoe is not enough.  They cause blisters on my heel at the top.  I hope that stops as they break in because the rest of the shoe is great.
I have very high arches and am constantly battling planter fasciitis.  Chacos tend to work well for my feet so i thought I would try these for running and walking.  I added my own insoles on top of the ones that came with the shoes and have been running for 4 weeks with no problems!
"I bought these when I needed something to wear for hiking AND city walking that wasn’t ugly AF like most hiking shoes. Here I am two years later, my Chacos have strolled through nature trails and city streets in 30 states and 3 continents. The tread has finally worn down, so I’m getting a second pair. They’re great! Thank goodness for hiking shoes that come in civilized black, rather than fugly swirly browns."
"I love these shoes. I have walked, lite hiking and worked in them. They run just a little small. I ordered my normal size. I have plantar fasciitis and these shoes have been great for that."
"I was hesitant to buy tennis shoes from Chacos. I adore their sandals and the high arch support, but wondered if the same could be accomplished in their tennis shoes. I was wrong; these are awesome. I get on the treadmill first thing in the morning, and those of us with PF know, that's when the worst pain is. These make it so. much. better. Highly recommend."
"Was looking for a shoe for work,on feet and a lot of walking,that have a footbed like a pair of cheap flip flops bought last year that are similar to chacos. The flip flops are all I wear when not working, don't hurt my feet. So far,so good, just wish they came with a choice of width and my feet are different from each other. Like other reviews,on one heel it rubbed and the opposite foot it rubbed pinky toe with socks on, irritating! Just have to break-in. I go through ""work shoes""/inserts about 6 months.  On a side note, didn't appreciate the UPS man just throwing the package on porch! Just because no car doesn't mean no one home and watching."
"I absolutely love these shoes!I’ve ordered 2 pairs so far. Some of my favorite things about this shoe is that there’s little to no need to “break in” the shoe, they fit my wide feet very comfortably, they are very sturdy, and they are very comfortable and I can walk for miles and not get blisters! I mainly wear them for work. I work in a kitchen as a waitress and these do an amazing job. They grip well on slick surfaces, I just wouldn’t run on the slick surfaces. My last pair lasted me just shy of a year, but I did wear them pretty much everyday walking anywhere from 4-6+ miles a day give or take. They are also great for most  hiking endeavors.I highly recommend these shoes if you’re looking for a light hiking shoe or a gripping work shoe."
"Another well made product from Clarks. I've been wearing the Clarks brand for over 25 years now, and with just a couple exceptions, I have not been disappointed. When I order a size 12, I know it will fit right out of the box with mostly no break in period. These shoes are comfortable for every day wear and work. Very happy with the purchase."
Short break in time and great.
I'm on my feet all day. Did not feel fatigued at the end of the day. They were very comfortable.
This is a great product! I would purchase
Narrow shoe nowhere near US sizes..not real clarks..
Wear to work
Shoe is very comfortable. Came quick and packaged well
"Mi sono arrivate un paio di scarpe numero 27,da bambino 😅, Amazon hai toppato alla grande.È la seconda volta che mi succede con un paio di scarpe, ma l'altra volta l'errore ci stava un 20 al posto di un 24,stavolta al posto di un 43 un 27😅.Le metto come portafortuna appese allo specchietto della macchina? 😂"
"Ho ordinato un 43 ed è arrivato un 27. Vedo che oggi è stato inserito un commento con identiche problematiche. Spero tanto che sia una brutta coincidenza. Peccato, mi piacevano. Reso avviato."
"Ottimo prodotto la skechers non delude mai! Calza il giusto, mio figlio ci si trova benissimo!"
je ne suis jamais déçu avec cette marque
Nice brown color goes well with brown oe beige pants
Los tenis fueron para mi padre. Quedó muy felíz por como le calzan.  Es una marca que ya había probado antes y le gustaron tanto como los otros que tenía. El modelo y sus colores muy bueno.
"This is a great shoe, feels like a foot glove.I wish they had a wide size though it would have been super."
This is the most comfortable running shoes i've ever wear.
"Amazing shoes. Soft, light and cozy. Nothing to say more. Thank you Seller!"
Good for running
Adidas os best
"It was a bit of a wait, but completely worth it! Amazing shoe. I love them."
Improperly described
I purchased these sneakers for my son and they were listed as mens. When I received the shoes they said women's on the box and looked like women's sneakers. Very disappointed.
"Great shoes! I have a high arch and slightly wide foot, plus I suponate when I run. These fit perfectly and have the right support to keep my feet from rolling out. Plus half the price of my normal running shoes!! They also did well for lifting."
Le scarpe sono belle ma il rinforzo in plastica che dovrebbe tenere il piede più fermo dopo 1 mese di utilizzo si è rotto in entrambe le scarpe. Viene usata da un ragazzo di 15 anni di peso 55 kg per pallamano. una scarpa di questo tipo non può rompersi dopo 2 mese di allenamenti.
"SCHUHE für Gr.43 ein bisschen zu gross. Guter Halt für die Knöchel,  Qualitativ hochwertiger Schuh."
Zapatillas buenísimas para jugar a balonmano. Relación calidad - precio excelente y el envío rapidisimo
The shoes had very little support. This contributed to injury
Pris un 38 pour un 38 elles conviennent parfaitement et en plus elles sont jolies et classe au top
I bought these for my son because I was having a hard time finding a men's version in his size. The first time he wore them he set a PR in his 800. He has continued to improve and set PRs as a freshman runner in track. The shoes are comfortable enough for him to run his 800 and the 3200. They are very lightweight and yet durable because of the way the shoe is made and the material.
"My daughter uses this for track season and she was very pleased. The shoes are bright, which made it easy to spot her clear across the track: I just looked for her shoes when she was with her teammates in uniform and she was easy to spot. The shoes were very light, not heavy at all, which made them perfect for her to run in."
"For normal shoes, I am a size 7.5. I always wear size 8 for Saucony trainers, and 8.5 for Saucony spikes and XC spikes, but for these, they are really thin so I got 8 and that was perfect."
good quality for cost!
Ojo en algún lado dice que son de piel. NO lo son o para ser más exactos son de piel Vegana. Para el precio que tienen me estoy pensando en devolverlo.
Daughter loves them
My 12 year old daughter really likes this shoe. She said it is comfortable and fits very well. Someone else really likes it too since they stole her first pair lol!
Not wide enough for my own feet.  Nicely made product though.
good quality
I only received one side of this shoes.need the other side.need the left.
Beautiful shoes! Very thin and an exact fit to my size 7 foot. Since they are thin there is not much between them and the ground. There is very little arch support so would not recommend wearing more than few hours; especially if you have a chronic plantar.
"La mejor compra!!!! Hermosos, llegaron desde Estados Unidos en solo 5 días contando el fin de semana. La talla es perfecta, la calidad impecable. Seguiré comprando sin duda alguna a Amazon pues el precio de oferta menos de la mitad que la tienda acá en México y excelente calidad. Gracias Amazon!"
"Tomar en cuenta bien el número del calzado.Buenos materiales,diseño, me encantaron y llegaron en tiempo y buen estado"
"muy cómodos, compré un tercer par."
"Llegaron antes de lo esperado, me encantó el color, no tuve ningún problema con la talla."
Colores muy bonitos y súper cómodo ...
"Vienen un poco grandes, soy 38 pedí  un número menos (37) y quedaron perfecto."
Super cómodos y bonitos
Muy buen producto..!
Excelentes materiales y muy cómodos
Esta hermoso el modelo y súper cómodo
They fit bigger and are heavier than the Nike sneakers my daughter has but they look amazing!Really good sneakers for the price!
"The media could not be loaded.
                




   👍👍"
"Perfect. I let my daughter pick. I ordered a 1/2 size up as recommended. I probably could of gone a full size up. But my daughter has a narrow foot and I was afraid her foot would “flop out”. So we will pay the extra and go up a size as needed. If your child as a more average size foot, I would say you could size up at least 1/2-full size if they are on the cusp of that growth spurt. If your child has a wide foot, I do not recommend these shoes. Again-this is MY OPINION. I feel has been very fair and honest."
In the picture it shows laces. What I received was Velcro!  Twice!!!! Not happy
"Not as described, what made these look so undesirable was the fact that they came with a giant velcro strap across the top. THIS STRAP WAS NOT IN THE PHOTO. So I feel I was fooled. They look like old men  shoe. SAD!"
"My son was excited for these shoes. Unlike others, I WAS looking for velcro, because although he knows how to tie his shoes, he would rather slip them on and off, and I would rather still have a decent, rather then broken heel of his shoe. Turns out the heel was not the problem!! Instead, the toe part (it is cloth-woven on top of a more solid base) of the shoe began to unravel a couple months into wear, and now it looks completely frayed (over an inch or so) and tacky, revealing the plastic form of the shoe underneath. Otherwise the shoe has held up great, the white part in the front is fine, the tread on the bottom, it fits, he loves it, etc, but he will be getting a new pair of a DIFFERENT shoe, because I am not taking my chances on this pair again."
"These shoes are wonderful Adidas quality, but as others have stated, the item description is incorrect.  I ordered the royal blue color with laces, and received a velcro closure. It's otherwise a fantastic shoe, and the velcro closes all the way across, and stays shut. I think my son (almost 10) is just about too old to velcro, he disagrees so we're keeping them.  But I'll choose a different style next time."
"After being loyal to UA and Nike shoes for kids, I've recently dabbled in purchasing some Adidas shoes and am pleasantly surprised by their comfort and quality.  They tend to run slightly bigger and more true to size than Nike, which run small, and are better quality than UA which tend to wear quickly and have color wear off.  The Adidas are really the best if both Nike and UA with sizing and quality.  These are lightweight, attractive and fit well.  These are nice kids shoes and worthy of five stars."
"This shoe doesn't actually have the velcro strap, as it appears to have in the product image.If your child is like mine and not the best at tying their shoes yet, then you know that the velcro strap really comes in handy (which is the main reason why I selected this shoe to purchase), so needless to say, I was pretty disappointed that the product image was inaccurate.Other than that though, it's a good shoe and we decided to go ahead and keep it and continue perfecting our shoe-tying skills."
"They fit great! But we had these shoes for a month before they started falling apart. My son is 5. I bought these because two kids in my son's daycare ages 1 and 3 have these shoes and they're adorable. However, after a month they started falling apart. The toe part now looks like a dog started eating them. Its so sad especially for the price. Walmart shoes may have been a better bet for quality."
"I am a 73 year old Breast Cancer Survivor almost 9 years only 4' 11"" tall and wear children size shoes 3-1/2 XW.  Was thrilled when I found a pink shoe in the Big Kids Size that fit me perfectly.  It has extra depth so I can insert my Alegria insole protecting my feet that no longer have muscle due to chemo side affect.  Thank you for having this amazing shoe just right and comfortable for me when I walk or go to my Cancer Survivor Exercise Class!!"
"I've been buying new balance shoes for several years for my kids.  The new v4 of the 990's is just not good.  The quality has gone down, the fit is different and the shoes are completely falling apart in less than 2 months.  Stitching is coming out, hole in mesh on top of shoe, etc.  What's really shameful is that the cost of these v4's went up so much compared to the v3's.  When the quality comes back I'll reconsider."
"I think that the shoes are really nice, but I ordered the light grey 990 V4 in the size that my son normally wears and the shoes were like a half of a size 2 small (length). I went back to order the next size up and they were sold out. I ended up ordering the NB 888 in dark grey (Magnet) and they are even nicer with better support than the newer version 990."
DISGUSTING! I cannot even believe someone would pack these nasty shoes and pass them off as a new. Returning!
These are the ONLY tennis shoes my 5 year old can wear.  He has a wide foot with a large instep and he has trouble getting his feet in shoes.  These shoes are great because they come in a WIDE and EXTRA WIDE.  We bought the extra wide and they fit him perfectly and were super comfortable.
The shoes were really nice. I loved the color and how they looked on my sons foot. They fit exactly and the goal was to get them in a bigger size but the size was unavailable. I will purchase them again in a larger size for later as he grows. They were tremendous with issuing my refund. I did not like having to pay for shipping as part of my refund but the shoes were incredibly inexpensive so no complaints here.
Very nice quality and look. My child is very particular about her shoes and needs a wide space for her toes. These extra wide shoes are perfect. Couldn't find any other shoe out there to meet her needs.
Fast shipping. The shoe colors are off. The soles are thinner than the original 990. Not as much support. Emailed the support team about my concern but they never responded back. Returning the product.
"My foot doctor explained that the shoes are built so that they tilt inward in the heel area as most people walk this way.  Huh?  That's just plain nuts.  Secondly, the gray pair I bought a few months ago--same shoe--the back of the heel area--not the bottom of the shoe--has compressed after 3 weeks of wear.  After spending $80 on this New Balance 990 shoe, it's unwearable.  What a waste of my money.  We'll see how these new ones wear.  I'm not holding my breath."
"Seems to be a comfortable supportive shoe. As an adult female who still has to wear kid's shoes, I have a very hard time finding anything appropriate to wear. I hope New Balance continues to make at least one or two styles that are not pink and sparkly!"
"Meine Tochter hat den Schuh genau einmal getragen, und jetzt kann ich ihn wegschmeißen, weil der Reißverschluss kaputt ist."
Reißverschluss hält nicht-Schuhe wurden nur ein paar mal getragenBitte um Lösung dieses ProblemsVerbleibe mit lieben Grüßen Bauernberger Mathias
"der Reissverschluss geht etwas schwer zu, aber sonst ein schöner Schuh"
"Der Reißverschluss an der Seite geht fast nicht zu, Kinder Schaffen es alleine nicht und Erwachsene müssen kämpfen"
Cerniera rotta dopo averle indossate 5 volte
"Benutze den Schuh täglich, Lauf jeden Tag zwischen 5 und 10 Kilometer. Optisch ein schöner Schuh, alles in allem ist der Schuh zu weich, man merkt im Gelände jeden Stein unter der Sohle, schade. Denke nach einem halben Jahr bei der Laufleistung ist das Ding durch. Für jemanden der nur ab und zu mal wandern geht denke ich ganz Ok."
"Wirklich hochwertige Schuhe, leider fallen diese Recht klein aus, weshalb ich sie leider zurücksenden müsste."
Ottimo prodotto (lo conoscevo già)...ma la cosache più ho apprezzato è il notevole costo inferiore rispetto ad altri punti vendita....
vanno bene per una camminata di massimo 2 ore....pessima tenuta sulla parte alta del piede e suola troppo morbida per terreno sconnesso
"Fürs Hundegassi top,vorallem Wasserfest."
"Fazit nach 3 Monaten: Laufkomfort super, auch bei Wanderungen über 3 Stunden.Leider starker Verschleiß der Sohle durch täglichen Gebrauch (Spaziergang mit den Hund)."
Passt! Hatte schon einen CMP Schuh; gleiche Passform. Ich bin begeistert!
"Superschnelle Lieferung, Top Preis-Leistungsverhältnis, wurden schon eingelaufen und für bergetauglich bewertet"
Great looking shoe.  Can wear casually for work.  Get lots of compliments!
Very comfortable. Beautiful metalic gold. Nice shoelaces 2 pairs white and beige with gold ends.Love them. Since they are original keds they where what expected !
"Fast shipping and great pricing, thank you"
Great comfy shoes!!
"EXCELENTE PRECIO, SUPER COMODO. LO QUE ESPERABA. ME ENCANTO"
"I love it, I love it. Wouldn't mind buying other colors."
"Sehr schöner und bequemer Sneaker von ARA.  Weiches Wildleder, fällt größengerecht aus, stoßdämpfende Sohle und Wechelfußbett - klare Kaufempfehlung!"
"This is a great shoe for dressing up or casual wear. Love the style, color and fit (I wear an 8, had to send it back for a 7 1/2 which was absolutely no problem for return). I do have a narrow foot, so that is the reason for the smaller shoe. Very comfortable and good support."
I love love love these shoes! I’ve had a similar pair for five years and am so happy I found more of the same company/style on here. the absolute best and comfiest women’s shoes!!!
"I am always on the lookout for sporty shoes that I can slip on and don't have to wear socks with. It's not an easy find. With that said, these shoes are sporty and quite cute. They look almost knit and the gray color is a nice neutral. I was really pleased with how the shoe looked.In addition to a cute shoe, I require a decent amount of arch support (I love Vionic shoes). I purchased these because of all of the reviews noting these had great arch support. I have one question.....Where is said arch support? If you are expecting a decent amount of arch support (like a Vionic shoe) - this is NOT it. The insole has a bit of bump - else it's pretty flat without a lot of padding. I was super disappointed in how flimsy the insole was. The good thing is the insole is removable, so if you love the shoe and need more support - you can easily add your own insole."
I purchased this pair of Ryka ballet flats to replace a pair I bought a couple of years ago that I had worn out.  They are so incredibly comfortable and are the perfect flat to wear when you need to be a little more shoe than a pair of sneakers but not dragging out a pair of heels!
"I really like the Ryka black flat with a black sole.  No more clown feet with those big white rubber bumpers.  Shoe is comfortable in every way I appreciate...fit, style, lightweight and flexible, breathable fabric, and looks attractive with all of my pants and capris.  True to size in a size 10W... even a little room to wiggle my toes."
"I have several pairs of Ryka, all size 6.5.  I love the brand. These were huge in the heel area and a bit wide across the bridge of my foot. Before you ask I double checked to make sure they had not sent me the 6.5 Wide. It is stamped 6.5 M.  I am so disappointed because they are just what I needed. I do not think the size 6 would be any better due to the width."
"Absolute Comfort is what first comes to mind with these.  With these available in a Wide width it made for a perfect fit at 6 1/2 W.  These will be my go to slip ons for around the house, no break in needed.  I love them, it is like they were made for my foot!!"
"I ordered this in black and came back for two more colors.  I wear a size 9 and it was a full size 9 with a little room.  It is not narrow or tight, which I like.  I have been looking for comfy flats for awhile and Ryka got it right."
I ordered these in a 7.5 wide and they fit my wide foot comfortably. I do not notice any arch supports. I like these shoes. It is hard to find cute shoes for a wide foot. They are comfortable for a short term wear however I have not tried wearing them for super long periods of time so I cannot attest to how they feel after wearing for a whole day.
"These shoes are comfortable out of the box. I've been wearing them almost everyday since receiving them. When they get dirty, I toss them in the washer on delicate cycle and then air dry."
I bought these for my son and I was hoping they would be a good choice for the winter weather.  He likes them but one issue is that they're not comfortable for all day wearing.
Returned them. Too stiff and narrow for an athletic tween.
Awesome boots
Cool
Great
"Very  comfortable ,my grandson  loves  them. Keeps  feet very  warm."
Great Stuff!
Nice boots
"My son hasn't complained that they hurt, so far so good.  Fits well."
Están de moda con traje o ropa de vestir fue un regalo según para el 14 de Feb pero no aguante y se los día antes están padrisimos tipo piel con ante  el  los quería y andaba buscando por todos lados le encantaron los super recomiendo  talla exacta tipo para pie gordito super cómodos si tienes el pie delgado pide medio número menos
No me gusto que en el anuncio dice que se n de cuero y ya la realidad dice que es piel sintética para mí es un engaño están bonitos pero aún así queda un poco la duda de la autenticidad por eso le doy solo una estrella.
"Es lo que esperaba, el color me gustó mucho, el diseño en cuanto a la combinación del material con el cual están elaborados me encantó, y son realmente cómodos"
"Calza perfecto , muy cómodos , se ven muy buen con pantalon casual , muy buena relación calidad / precio."
Me encantaron la talla me quedo perfecto y son iguales a como lo mencionan en la descripción muy recomendable
"Buen acabado y ajuste perfecto, la gamuza le da un toque elegante si me agradaron mucho"
"Estan muy padres, comodos."
"Satisfecho con esta compra, me gustó mucho este modelo, bonito diseño y son cómodos."
"Son algo estrechos, pedí mi talla exacta pero aún así me quedo algo chico pero igual ya los cambié mejor por una más grande"
"Muy buen producto, tardaron como 5 días en adaptarse a mi pie, por lo que fue un poco incómodo al principio, después me quedaron muy bien."
"These sneakers are comfortable, not as light as running shoes but good enough for being casual sneakers. The size is a bit bigger than expected. I got a Women's 7.5 US size and it's equal to a 39 2/3 EU size (usually a 7.5 it's a 38 or 38.5 on other brands)."
"i liked the retro design and the chunky look ..also was a great price for this brand so i assumed it would fit wide..but it only looks wide but feels narrow on the toe part, hurt the feet"
I like these shoes but they are way way way too big. I am a size 7.5 and I ordered my size and they fit more like a 9.5! Massive shoes and not true to size. I gave them away
Increibles
"I like the shoe, just like the picture"
A little rough inside
These shoes are a little heavy but that is likely because I tend to go for lightweight sneakers. The shoes are really cute and Love the style. My issue is comfort. I wore these for a day and they are not small but something about how they fit causes some discomfort around my toes and ankle. Not unbearable and there is enough room to wear thicker socks that should offer some more comfort.
Where them when I going to the park
"if you have over arching feet this isn’t the shoe for you, the sole on the ball isn’t that thick so after awhile my feet start to hurt but if you’re just wearing for a couple hours they’re great"
A little narrow. But overall cool retro look.
"Excelentes están fenomenales, al venir de Amazon USA ya van 2 veces que no me llega con caja original , la cambian por maltrato de transporte en cuanto al tenis están de lujo"
Cómodas y bonitas
Der Schuh ist sehr bequem und leicht zu tragen. Alles so wie erwartet.
The sizing of these is way off. I listened to the reviews and ordered a whole size larger than normal (I wear a lot of NB shoes of this same style) and they were right I needed a whole size larger in length but they were very narrow. I returned them and ordered the same thing in a wide only to find that this shoe was not only wider but much longer also. so I guess you should order a half size larger and wide in order to get a proper fit? I give up.  I wouldn't recommend ordering these online unless you know for a fact what size is appropriate. Try these on first if at all possible.
"I purchased these shoes a little under 2 weeks ago and am not impressed with the durability of the stitching on them. I skate maybe an hour every other day but I do not do any crazy tricks, an Ollie and kickflip if I’m feeling it and this is just from a small time frame of wearing them. My previous vans half cabs lasted 9 months. I had heard good things about New Balance for skating but am not impressed with them at all. They are also not comfortable in the slightest, even after wearing them in a good bit. Maybe I got a bad batch but if not, do better New Balance."
"I ordered the 11.5 Wide, since New Balance has been exceptionally consistent in sizing for me. To my surprise, these did not fit when I tried them on. The reason is they're not the standard 4E wide for New Balance, but only 2E wide. I tried two of these before realizing the problem. They look great, but if you're buying it for the width, be sure to know they're not standard wides."
"I like these shoes.  They're comfortable, and look cool.  But like the other reviewers stated......order one to 1.5 sizes larger than you normally do."
I didn’t even know that New Balance made skate style shoes. These shoes look nice and feel great. The only thing I am not a fan of is the big “N” sticked on the side. Branding is branding... oh well. The shoes breathe and help keep the feet from getting a serious case of the stankfoot.
"I should have paid closer attention to the reviews!  I have purchased several New Balance shoes and these 9.5W are tighter than past pairs.  I have been thinking that the material will break in over time; however, the tightness is around the panels that secure the sides/laces.  That firm material doesn't seem to have much give and it immediately aches.  Other than, the shoe is well constructed.  I'm disappointed I will have to return the shoes for a 10W."
I bought my original fit that I buy for all shoes and these were nowhere near the size.  I couldn't even get the shoes on over my toes.  I got refund so no harm no foul.

"Die Schuhe sehen niedlich aus. Da sie so aufdringlich riechen, habe ich sie 2x gewaschen. Sie stinken immer noch elendig, so dass ich sie meinem Kind nicht anziehen möchte, da ich denke, dass sie nicht gesundheitlich unbedenklich sein können."
Wie bei jedem Kappa Schuh ist die Passform perfekt. Durch den schmalen Schnitt wirken sogar meine Füße in Größe 43 klein:-)
Super weicher Material. Mein Sohn benutzt zum Fußball!!!
ARTICOLO ARRIVATO SENZA SCATOLA ORIGINALE E SENZA FATTURA O SCONTRINI. DUBITO CHE LE SCARPE SIANO ORIGINALI!🤨
Très bien et adapté à son utilisation.
Super bon achatBonne grandeurParfait
Bought these for my son for Xmas .  He absolutely loves them. Very bright and super comfy.
"Fit, comfort, price ..... all good"
Very good quality for the price
light and comfortable!!!
"I have two wild boys whom are 7 and 10.  They love gym and are always involved in at least one sport per season.  They are very hard on shoes because they live to run and jump.  We bought several pairs of the Reebok ATV after my oldest son saw the great commercial for them and decided he had to have a pair.  My boys wore the crap out of them and loved every minute of it.  Please bring those shoes back.  We have been hooked on Reebok for their comfort and durability ever since.I bought each of my boys a pair of the Yourflex Train 10s for Christmas to wear to school and for Gym class.  The different colored tread on the bottom of the shoes have begun to come undone after two days each.  It was obviously added last in the factory in order to enhance the appearance, but is a complete fail as it has lowered the functionality of the shoe tremendously.I've seen this happen with other shoe companies that attempt the same visual tactic.  In the future, I will not buy any shoe that screws around with the sole like this.  I'm disappointed Reebok.  I've grown to expect more from your company.  I will continue to buy your brand, but will pay more attention to what i'm buying."
"I had to send the first pair back. A piece of the sole ripped off after only a few wears and my son only wore them to school. I did reorder them bc my son loved the look, and said they were comfortable. So just hoping it was a fluke.  Nope, they didn't hold up.  Don't waste your money."
This is my second time buying a pair of Reeboks for my kindergartner. They look great and fit well. The only trouble is the listing is confused so I received the ALT model instead of the model that is described.
I can't speak to the quality since we sent these back.  The picture and description led me to believe the shoes were lace up shoes.  I ordered a size 1 and when they arrived they were a velcro closure which is not what we were looking for.  Otherwise it was a nice looking shoe.
"my child loves these and the black and red color. comfortable sneaker, great price."
"Hard to review a shoe.Wearing them as I'm writing this.  Super comfortable. Perfect for walking, gym, everyday.Will get soaked in the rain, obviously.Easy to clean and dry."
"Amazing shoes and fit perfectly. Light weight, good traction, and overall great price (I got them for half price)."
"These shoes are a hit or miss. I bought two pairs, and it seemed the two pairs were different. Although the underlying shape was the same, the sole on one of them was grey and the other was white. Also, the 10.5 size was somehow bigger than the size 11, to our confusion. The shoes is also very similar to mens sizing, as opposed to womens sizing, which is also very confusing."
Love these. A bit lightweight so can not imagine they would last long if you actually wore them running. I use them for casual day to day use.
These are great light running shoes at a very good price.
"Excelente producto, tal y como se describe, excelente calidad, comodidad y tiempo de entrega"
Love them
Fits a little bigger than I expected but they are extremely comfortable
IL FAUT PRENDRE1 À 2 POINTS PLUS PETITS.
"At least half size down, it’s too big"
These shoes are super comfortable and really cute.  Best purchase ever!  They fit true to size.
"I find this shoe to be very comfortable. I bought them due to having joint (foot and knees) problems. I do have a challenge in getting them on as fit nice and snug to prevent the foot from slipping around. A zipper up the front would be nice. And yes, i will buy them again."
"We got what we wanted - a sensible, comfortable, no-nonsense pair of shoes - no fashion statement but  just right for walking and not tripping, running and not slipping, hopping and never skipping."
This product actually is making my plantar faciaitis better after 6 mons of pain. Like walking on baloons...very happy
"The shoes look good, feel good. It is just that when I wear shoes all day they have to be soft because my toes will hurt. The shoes are soft and because they are new I need to work them in."
They are so comfortable  and I love the colour.  Very good product.  👍
Great sneaker. I have problems with plantar fasciitis. Great walking shoe.
This shoe doesnt come in half sizes. I bought 2. The smaller one is too small and the larger is too large. Both very uncomfortable bc of this. A shame for an attractive shoe.
Gift to granddaughter says fit and feel great all day
"I bought this for my daughter and she loves it so much!Very comfortable, feel good on your feet and the color pink is very attractive."
These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn.  Snug around the heel and lots of room.  So far I don't have any foot pain.  Would definitely recommend
"The sizing chart is wierd because it's Unisex Sizing. My foot is 9""x3"" and according to the listing's size chart, I should order a Men's 5/Woman's 6. However, I'm a US Woman's Size 7/7.5 and can wear a Men's 5.5/6.Since this seller offers free returns, I went ahead and ordered the recommended Size 6 (in case the sizes were Men's) and a Size 7 (in case the sizes were Woman's) so I could compare fit.The Size 6 was too snug and short. The Size 7 fits well, lengthwise but is a tad wide. I kept the 7 because I wear socks and wanted to use an insole for plantars fasciitis. The shoes do not come in a box, they come in a nice little bag - which makes them perfect for Returing the Size 6 was as easy as taking the unpacked shoe bag to Kohl's (although, since I have a printer, I chose to drop it off at UPS in the original reusable Amazon bag).A previous reviewer mentioned that they broke their ankle wearing these shoes. I can see how that could happen because the 3D-Knit weave of this particular shoe is very pliable and soft. Literally, the shoe upper feels like a loose fitting sock your Grandma might crochet. The collar of the shoe is so flimsy, a hard kick would likely send the shoe flying off your foot. So, it is impossible for me to imagine anyone running in this shoe or walking faster than 10-15 mins per mile. There simply is not enough structure to the body of the shoe for any type of performance activity. These shoes are not in the same league and will not perform at anywhere near the same level as Adidas Primeknit, Nike Flyknit or similar type of slip-on sneakers.However, it's a very comfortable, light weight shoe and perfect for casual wear and short walks. It is a great grab and go shoe and, unlike the higher end brands names, I find these to be convenient airport security shoes because they are incredibly easy on/easy off and won't make me a target for theft as I leave the airport or check into a hotel.The listing photos do not so the shoe justice. They are cute, fashionable and comfortable. I say this as a person who owns over 100 shoes at or near the $150 price point.If you plan on doing a lot of walking (over 5 miles), I'd recommend getting a good orthotics insole for arch support and heel impact (or wear a performance walking shoe instead). That being said, I recommend these Sneakers as a low-cost option for travel because they are light weight, great for casual walking, easy to pack, and perfect for security check points.NOTE: I was NOT compensated in any way for my review. I paid full price for the pair I'm wearing in the photo. I think some of the other reviews may be fake so I wanted to add a comprehensive and honest review."
There's nothing I dislike about these shoes. I haven't had shoes this comfortable in years. I am a size 9 and that's what I ordered and the fit is perfect. I've been wearing them daily for hours and these shoes are the best comfort of any expensive shoe I've purchased in the past.  I'm elated and thanks for supplying an affordable comfortable shoe!
"These are super fun looking shoes. People ask me about them every time I wear them. Most of the upper shoe is knit-like and airy and really comfortable. However there's also too much slippage in the toebox and my feet roll to the inside with each step. I wouldn't wear these if I needed to do much walking, but for average wear they're ok. They're fun and colorful and I hope they last long enough for me to get over them. Lol. I ordered  my actual size, but turns out a half-size smaller might've been better. I don't think that would've improved the pronation though."
"Just getting started with these! Love it!! Really nice option for running and athletics. Might want to add gels, but I need a softer foot-bed. Upper is a little extra pliable and less secure than the old-school toebox, but the quality is fight on par with all the top brands of similar design."
"Truly Excellent sneaker, they are very well made and extremely comfortable. If you have any foot problems these are your answer ,They give to accommodate most foot issues. They are extremely lightweight and I bought the Multi/Color which is truly an eye catcher. Do not pass these up !"
This is great shoes very comfortable and very lightweight. It is really good for walking and running. Its ture size and great value. Its breathable and can wear them all day and never get sweating feet. I recommend this shoes.
I bought these as a birthday gift for my hubby. He loves them and wears them all the time. Lightweight and comfortable.
"One of the shoes is angled awkwardly making me walk off my gait. Makes me walk with my foot leaning inward as if I have no arch. I waited too long to return them, so they're going in the trash"
"I really liked the quality of this pair of shoes, great color too. Awesome price. The shoes feel real comfortable too."
"I got a half size larger and it works perfectly, i hate wearing shows so this is close as i get with out having to wear flip flops."
Zapatos cómodos y bonitos. Desde q llegaron mi niña solo quiere ponerse esos. Tallan correcto y quedan muy guapos puestos. Amazon como siempre genial en el envío
son geniales. los compré para mi niña para una boda y perfectos. comodos y bonitos
"Taille très grand. J'ai commandé du 43 (ma pointure exacte), j'ai bien reçu une chaussure étiqueté en 43 mais  celles-ci sont beaucoup trop grande ! il y a environ 2 cm de vide au bout du pied. Je pense que cela équivaut à du 45.Choqué de lire made in Taïwan sur l'étiquette !"
"Muy bonitos, tal cual se muestra en la foto, la entrega fue muy rápida."
"Super, erstklassige schuheNur Leider Lange Lieferzeit"
"Zugegeben Boys Ballerina klingt etwas dämlich .Ich würde sagen, es ist eine sehr gute, qualitätsvolle geschlossene Sandale.Innen super weiches LederAussen auch Echtleder und eine hochgezogene, rutschfeste GummisohleEinfach ein gelungener KinderschuhDer Kinderschuh ist nicht schlabbrig weich sondern gibt den Kinderfüßen halt und das Leder drückt trotzdem nichtFroddo fällt ein kleines bisschen größer aus als gewohnte Marken"
The slight wedge makes it uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. I thought it was a flat sporty boot. It does fit on the large size. I should have gone half size down. Will keep them anyway.
"Really happy with these - they are very cute and exactly what I wanted. I like to get an extra 2-3” in a hidden wedge if possible!One note - the soft furry lining that you see coming out at the top of the shoe only goes down about an inch inside. The heel area and inside of the shoe is NOT lined with it. it doesn’t bother me really, but the picture makes it seem like it’s lined when it’s not."
I tested the shoes in the rain today and they felt great! They kept my feet warm and dry the whole time! They are also comfortable. I live in NYC so I walk everywhere all day long. I was looking for a stylish pair of waterproof sneaker shoes and they are perfect! Though they are not fully lined with faux fur they have a bit of fur trim around the ankle which feels pretty good. I will definitely buy more shoes from this company. I am very satisfied with the product.
"Loved the look of this sneaker/boot...functional yet stylish and that's exactly how it looks when wearing it. Really like the zippers on each side that makes it so easy to get them on and off. Would recommend them to anyone looking for a comfortable, yet not heavy, boot for cold weather."
They are really cute but not super comfortable. I am size 7 and 6.5 was to big I to order size 6
it fits as expected.. but the sole is really uncomfortable..
You got Grego she like them the Color was ok yet if they were Blond tiny bit mo Fur eighter inside if not Outside they would of been loved
Super cute and really comfortable. Something I've been looking for.
"Love the look for these boots, but not super comfortable and very narrow, my suggestion order up a half size and in wide"
My daughter absolutely loves them.  They fit just perfect
My mom enjoys her shoes. Easy to put on and fasten the straps
THIS WAS A GREAT BUY. I PURCHASED THESE FOR MY GRANDMOTHER. WE HAD A HARD TIME FINDING SHOES BECAUSE OF THE SWELLING IN HER FEET WHICH CAUSED HER TO BE UNBALANCED. WE TRIED NEW BALANCE AND OTHER BRANDS. WHEN SHE TRIED THESE ON SHE SAID THEY FEEL GOOD THE WIDTH COMFORT AND THE SOFTNESS OR THE SHOE AND ABLITY TO ADJUST THE STRAP WAS GREAT. NOT TO MENTION THE PRICE.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM ESP FOR PEOPLE WITH FEET ISSUES
Got a great fit and didn't have to be hassled by traffic!
"Schuhe statt beige, habe in grau erhalten.."
Absolut vielseitiger Schuh
These were great but they rubbed my ankles and my upper heal real bad. I got my full return and ordered the facet 60 low. They cut better around my ankle. These would be great for anyone who doesn’t have a hard time with a high top shoe.
"Riktigt snygga skor, dessvärre stora i storleken. Skulle behövt gå ner nästan en storlek jämfört med adidas / Reebok. Annars riktigt god kvalité samt ergonomiska .Därav de ändå får 5 stjärnor. Rekommenderas"
"Apparently an used pair. Wrinkles on the upper leather (especially at the heel), loose elastic band, and dirt at the sole with worn marks (see the second picture lower right). Disappointed."
"It fits my husband perfectly. I don’t think I‘ll be able to get him to wear another brand. When his new ones start to look old, I get him a new pair. This pair is one of his Christmas presents!"
Really like these shoes from SAS. Ordered them in an extremely hard to find size : 14 AA ( slim ) . They look and fit great. Highly recommend these American made shoes.
I dont know what it is but its not comfortable. I have been buying the white leather of the same model which is very comfortable so I thought a change might be nice but no
Extremely comfortable. I have wide feet and flat feet. These shoes fit well and re not tight and are very comfortable!  I've had them for a out 2 months and they are great. Made in the USA is important too!
"Am a repeat buyer of SAS shoes, very comfortable and durable shoes worth the money"
This is my husbands second pair.  He loves them.  Very comfortable.  Wear well.  He had a pair he has worn every day for two years and they still look very good.  I bought these as a spare pair.
"Best shoe ever!! I walk miles eash up and down the halls. I work in a Children's hospital, so my shoes take a beating. The last pair lasted for 2 years. Nike and Adidas I had to buy every 4-5 months. Thank You San Antonio Shoes!"
Great shoes. Comfortable right out of box. Excellent workmanship. Happy made in USA.
This is the third set of these sneakers that my husband has bought.  His foot pain went away instantly.  His podiatrist recommended he stick with SAS too.
This is my third pair of SAS Journey Mesh Sneakers.  The feel is very nice and they are very durable.  The best shoe I've owned.  The big plus is that they are made in the USA.
"Really confortable, I wear them as slippers...I ordered a size 5 as I usually wear 6 but I saw that it was men's size. Fits perfect!"
"I love these, you can tell that it is a quality product. Brilliant."
Love them. So comfy!
Not woman
It's definitely not soft.I bought it since it said in the product description. But it's not soft
Très bonne
"Best sandals, amazingly comfortable."
So confortable! Exactly what I expected! The sole is so smooth.
good comfort for your feet on hard surfaces. got them fir a trip.
👌🏽👌🏽
Der Artikel wurde in einem gebrauchten Zustand geliefert ohne Originalkarton und mit abgerissenen Etiketten. Die Stiefel weisen Abriebspuren auf und der Staub vom tragen des Vorbesitzers haftete noch an. Eine Unverschämtheit!
"I rant and rave to all my friends about these shoes! They are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever bought. I’m an orthodontic technician so I’m constantly up and down on and off my feet for 10+ hours a day depending on the day. I have never had a pair of shoes that helped my feet, legs, and back from hurting after a long shift till I bought these. Best part is I bought a second pair for my everyday shoes also!"
"“My New Lightweight Sneakers “ I a size 8 Medium, I received these today, I tried the shoes on, the shoes have nice arch support, lightweight, comfortable, nice mauve color, I bought a size 8, my shoes fit true to size, I will purchase another pair in the future, the sneakers also make nice house slippers, also have minimal stretch, I received a nice compliment on my shoes.😊"
I got these to wear around the house instead of going barefoot on the hardwood. They are very comfortable and cute. For my purposes I had hoped they would slip on and off a bit easier. I still have to lean down to get the heel straightened out. I haven’t worn them out but I think they would be fine.
"I almost forgot I was wearing shoes because my feet get so much air when I wear these. It's been over 90° where I live and I wore these without any socks...when I took my shoes off my feet were COMPLETELY dry & not sweaty at all. They are so comfortable and flexible. Also standing for long periods have been easier. I just ordered 4 more pair.l, one for my mom, my daughter & two more for yours truly. Very happy."
"These seemed to be made fairly decent, may even wear well, but while the fit was OK in length and the width seemed good they were too tight on my feet.After wearing them for a few minutes it became uncomfortabe and I had to remove them.Glad I only wore them indoors on carpet so I was able to return them."
Very tight. I’ve had a shoe stretcher in for days and my feet still start to hurt within the first hour of wearing these. A shame because they are very lightweight and something I’d love to wear daily. I’ll keep trying to stretch them out!!
"Los tenis son super cómodos y de un peso ligero. Lo único en lo cual no estoy muy satisfecha es en las condiciones en las que llegaron. Ambos tenían una mancha, el derecho en la parte superior de al frente, y el izquierdo en la parte de al lado al frente, también. De todo lo demás muy conforme con el artículo."
Great shoes.  Buy bigger6.5 is 37! Too small .  Returned.7 is 37 ! Wow.  Too small. Returned.  What do I need to order to get a 38??
I have a hard time finding cute shoes in a size 13. Happy to find these—cute and comfortable
"While I hate sneakers, I knew I would need something comfortable for our upcoming vacation, lots of walking every day. Ordered these recently and I am in love. I usually go barefoot at home but these are so nice in my feet I keep them on even at home! I thought I'd have to break them in but honestly they feel like they were made for my feet and I find myself styling my outfits so I can wear them! Super, super comfortable and cute!"
"Excelentes tenis y la calidad y precio súper convenientes. Cómodos, suaves, bonito color. A mi hijo le encantaron y se los puso de inmediato. Los recomiendo."
Bungee laces which are awesome. Fits as expected.
"Excelente  calidad, durabilidad y muy bien en relación precio producto"
Llegaron bien y antes de la fecha
"Our 11 year old has big feet! LOL!  Had trouble finding shoes wide enough.  I know that New Balance is a good brand, and have worn them myself before.  They are not expensive Adidas and Nike - which all our shoe store seems to want to carry - both Adidas and Nike were not wide enough - he was wearing a pair of Nike's and having a lot of issues with his feet hurting when we would go for our morning walk.  These don't hurt his feet and they are good solid comfortable shoes.  It's important to have good shoes that fit for your child...and they you want to be as cost effective as possible because they need a new pair every 6 months.  You don't want to buy a brand that's going to fall apart or not provide any support from a cheap big box store.  So try these!  Especially if your child has a wide foot.  I don't care for the red - but he likes red."
"These arrived as described. They were cute and easy for my four-year-old to slip on and off by himself. He has wide feet, but these fit true to size and he says they are comfortable. I am really disappointed with the quality. He's been wearing them for three weeks and they are already starting to fall apart! The entire family usually wears New Balance because of quality and comfort. I've never had a pair feel this cheap. I'm honestly wondering if they are knockoffs?"
"I love these, for myself. A great deal for women buying children’s sizes. A 5.5 is a woman’s size 7. I also like that I can just pull on, the faux laces are awesome. However if you are wide width as I am, consider a regular. New Balance seems to run wide to begin with and this is the 3rd pair I have wished I had gotten regular width in..."
"These shoes are very vibrantly. My son said they were comfortable. He usually wears a size 6 but after reading reviews I went with a 7 and they fit him good. The price was reasonably priced, an overall a good buy. I will be purchasing more colors."
"These shoes look nice, but they are regular tie laces, not bungee laces.  See photo. I also sized up, based on other reviews, and they are way too big.  These definitely run true to size."
"I bought these sneakers for my 4th grader to wear to camp. He was so happy not to be bothered with tying and untying his shoes all the time. They are so comfortable too, I'm planning on buying a pair for myself.  These sneakers give the support needed with laces but the ease of a slip on shoe. My son did say that if moves a certain way then sometimes his foot will fall out of the shoe, but this is true if the laces are loose as well."
"horrible, uncomfortable"
"Bought these for my 85 year young mother in law.  She loves them .  Stylish, comfortable, well made , secure footing and reasonable priced.  She loves them."
Love these! Go with just about everything.
"Super comfortable, love fit, love look"
Too heavy and wintery

"This product isn't true fit like the description says. They're way too big and large for the regular Clarks Size Chart I used to buy. My husband brought a 10.5 W pair, wich is his regular size in this particular shoe brand and they were way too big, like 1.5 bigger size. Then I decided to order the shoes again in a Smaller size (10 W), cause he actually like this model so much, and as you can see in the picture they were exactly the same size, even that we I ordered it half size smaller. I'm really disappointed cause my husband has tons of Clarks Shoes and this is the first time this happen, maybe because I didn't buy the in the store. If you are gonna buy them choose them 1.5 smaller size."
"I liked these even though they are more blue than I expected.  But I had to return them because they are sized pretty small.  The length was close to the proper size but the width was definitely narrow. Unfortunately, they do not come in a wide version of my size."
Very comfortable and good-looking shoes but the sizing are way off. Size 10.5 is more like size 11.5.-12 They look huge in comparison to my other similar type of shoes and are at least 1/4 inch longer. I had to return two pairs to get the right fit from size 10.5 to size 9!
Muy bonitos y cómodos.
"Super comfortable for my flat feet and true to size. I wear these to work a few times of week, they feel like tennis shoes! I will be buying at least another pair in another color."
Nice shoes. Based off the reviews I ordered an 11 when normally my husband is a size 12-13. Perfect fit.
Excelente calzado
Fits well and looks great. The gray and white go well together. Most people never mention my shoes but these got a compliment.
Love these shoes.  Clarkes fit me well and I was looking for casual above sneakers.  Very nice shoes.  comfortable  thx
Spend 30 more dollars and get the original ones
I love the look of this shoes and wanted them to fit so much.There is no room for the toes… I ordered a size bigger and my toes were still showing lol! I don’t have fat toes
"Mejor de lo esperado y justo a tiempo la Entrega, perfecto embalaje"
"Muy hermosos mejor que en foto, color bello, talla es justa"
Super nice quality shoes. The fabric is like a nylon. Love em
Esta perfecto y cómodo
"I've been hoping to get these sneakers for a while now, and when Sperry ran out, I turned to Amazon. The first thing I noticed, pulling the shoes out of the box, was a faint yellow stain on the right shoe and some yellowing in the laces. It really isn't a big deal, since it kind of goes with the vintage vibe(ish) but when I tried the shoes on, they were SUPER wide in the front, and only in the front. In all fairness, I have really narrow feet, but my other pair of Sperry's fit me perfectly fine so I'm not sure if they changed something up. Anyhow, the look of the shoes is fantastic, so that's a plus."
"Very cute, comfortable and fits as expected. The sole is not too high either, for people that are used to flat shoes."
Perfect
"Talla adecuada, buena calidad, son cómodas."
"Las chanclas son perfectas, muy cómodas."

"Best shoes I’ve worn for volleyball the only concern is lack of cushion near the balls of the feet but besides that traction, lockdown, comfort, and design were perfect. If you play for 3+ hrs that’s when u begin to feel some soreness in your feet. For volleyball players this shoe I’d recommend to setters and liberos/ds just because of response and reaction time was just much better with those I didn’t worry about lag when it came to passing and stepping into a setting position for hitting its mediocre there’s a lack of ankle support and if ur a hitter that jumps often I’d say just watch out with the landing because that’s what prevented a full 5 stars."
She absolutely loves these shoes
Fit great
Good but bigger and wider..
Love these. Been searching for ages for this colour and style. Perfect!
I love these shoes!!  I am a nurse and am on my feet for 14+ hours.  These get me through the day without any problems!!  Love adidas and their torsion control line of shoes!!
They feel amazing on my feet. I work 12 hours on concrete floors and my feet don’t hurt.
"Der Sneaker sind wirklich toll aus und wirkte bequem.  Ich hätte ihn gerne behalten und war etwas Hin-und hergerissen, aber: er roch so schlimm nach Chemie! Man bekam umgehend Kopfschmerzen. Ich habe mich dann entschlossen, soetwas nicht an den Füßen tragen zu wollen. Schade eigentlich!"
"Wunderschöner Schuh! Bequem und alles topLeider stört mich der weiße Stoff auf den Zehen, da dieser sehr sehr empfindlich ist."
Schönes und großartiges Design
Ich behalte den Artikellg Doris
Super!
"Passform perfekt und sie sind superleicht und bequem. Ich finde die Farbe wunderbar für den Sommer, intensiv aber nicht zu grell. (Ich wurde zwei mal von fremden, freundlichen jungen Frauen angesprochen, woher ich die Schuhe habe, das ist mir mit anderen Schuhen noch nicht passiert :)"
"Dieser Schuh hat auf ganzer Linie enttäuscht! Leider muss man einen Stern geben! Vorne zu eng, hinten zu weit. Eine Passform, die ich noch bei keinem Schuh erlebt hab. Dazu kommt, dass das Material billig wirkt....ich habe einige Schuhe von adidas, so dass ich gute Vergleichsmöglichkeiten habe. Die Rücksendung erfolgte problemlos (allerdings erst nach einem Telefonat mit dem sehr freundlichen und hilfsbereiten Anbieter hin kostenfrei)"
"Einer meiner Lieblingsschuhe. Sehr leicht und mega bequem. Was mir nicht ganz gefiel war hinten der weiße Abschnitt mit der pinken adidas Aufschrift. Aber nun gut, da sehe ich gerne drüber hinweg. Ich finde er sieht real besser aus als auf den Fotos. Der Versand ging übrigens blitzschnell!"
"Das Material ist recht steif, so dauert es schon etwas länger bis der Schuh eingelaufen ist und anfangs kommt manein wenig schwer hinein. Etwas flexibleres Matwerial wäre hier besser.Die Nähte rundumwiesen keine Mängel auch, das hatte ja ein anderer Rezensent geschrieben, hier zum Glück nicht."
Die Schuhe wurden schnell im Karton verpackt geliefert und passen perfekt. Die Verarbeitung ist sauber und das Modell günstiger als im Laden. Dank der grauen Farbe passt der Sneaker zu jedem Outfit. Sehr bequemer Tragekomfort!!
"Son zapatillas de calle, no para hacer deporte. Son muy cómodas, están bien acabadas y son muy bonitas. Yo he pedido el mismo número que uso en zapato de calle y quedan perfectas."
"Finde den Schuh super, passt perfekt! Habe 38 und habe den Schuh in der Größe bestellt und der passt!"
Der Schuh ist super trage in Adidas LA Trainer Größe 38 2/3 in Adidas Los Angeles 39 1/3 und in diesen brauch ich 40
Passt wie angegossen.Entspricht der angegebenen Größe.Form und Farbe sowie Material sind super.Schuh trägt sich wunderbar. Super leichtes Tragegefühl.
Muy guapas y comodas estan muy bien
"Meiner Tochter haben die Sandalen sofort gut gefallen und auch direkt gepasst. Sie lassen sich gut zu vielen Kleidungsstücken kombinieren. Das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis stimmt.Leider sitzt die eine Ferse (womöglich durch die Riemenkonstruktion) oft schief im Schuh.Meine Tochter rockt Schuhe schnell herunter. Diesmal hat die Sohle bisher gut gehalten, dafür schloss der Klettverschluss nicht mehr richtig. Ich habe daher die Nähte am Klettband abgetrennt und den Klettstoff mit Klettband aus dem Hobbymarkt ersetzt. Es war selbstklebendes Band. Festgenäht habe ich es nicht noch einmal extra und es hält seit nunmehr 2 Wochen ohne Probleme und schließt wieder gut."
"Je les ai achetées pour ma fille de 11 ans et demi, qui a le pied  fin , la marque possède des modèles à scratch qui permettent de règler la sandale .  (les marques que je prenais habituellement  s'arrêtaient au 34-35 quand j'ai acheté celles-ci, ou bien il n'y avait plus la pointure ou bien elles restaient trop chères). Première deception: les scratchs croisés de devant ne peuvent pas resserrer la sandale,  il n'y en a qu'un qui est scratché, celui en textile ne bouge pas et la sandale est faite pour un pied medium- large et pas fin,  par contre en longueur  elles sont  plutôt courtes. Les sandales n'ont pas crée un attrait irrésistible, c'est vrai qu'elles sont confortables et la semelle est épaisse et souple. Le problème de ces sandales c'est qu'elles sont un hybride râté entre la sandale classique et la sandale de marche .La partie en textile est malvenue et donne une impression ""tchip"", Le ""cuir"" ne couvre pas assez le pied pour le protéger et les couleurs sont peu séduisantes . Le prix de base est exagérément élevé, le prix Amazon (46 euros) reste cher.Ce ne sont ni des GBB (pour la qualité et l'esthétisme) ni des geox pour le confort ou le coté sportif. Autant acheter un premier prix chez Decathlon.Au bout de même pas un mois, la partie textile est déjà bien sale et la sandale bien usée ."
wir hatten bereits das Vorgängermodell. Dieses war weit besser verarbeitet und sah auch besser aus. Allein das Fussbett war besser - das Fussbett hier ist aus weissem Kunststoff!!! Ich habe den Schuh daher zurückgeschickt und das Vorgängermodell gebraucht gekauft.
"sandali per ragazzina di ottima qualità, tutti in pelle, soletta morbida, suola rialzata e flessibile"
habe sie mittlerweile in 5 verschiedenen Farben und trage keine anderen Sandalen mehr... Wer einen hohen rist hat sollte eventuell eine Grösse grösser bestellen
"Sehr schöne sandale Qualitätsuper,leider mur bis größe 35 war für unsere Tochter zu knapp....schade"
Very comfortable and good quality
"Die Sandale ist noch nicht in Benutzung macht aber einen sehr guten Eindruck, Superfit halt. Ich finde, die Sandale fällt eine Nummer größer aus."
"Absolut ungeeignet für Kinder. Kein Halt, falsche Fußstellung wird gefördert!. Für den Preis unmöglicher Schuh!"
Sehr schön
"Bought these for outdoor wear. I have purchased NB shoes in the past with no problem but I sent these back the same day I received them. I read the reviews re: tendency to run small. So I ordered a size larger (length) and instead of my usual 4E I ordered 6E.  Waaaay to tight. To the point it was ridiculous. Figured they gave me the wrong size. Nope. Right there on the label. When 1 person says they're to tight, that's one thing. When a dozen people say it, something is wrong. NB should be ashamed."
"I have big, fat, flat ""Fred Flintstone"" kind of feet.  On top of that, I've developed Plantar Fascitis  after 50 years of working on my feet.  I tried multiple boots and found no comfort.  For anyone with wide feet, you know its hard to find much selection for you, and it's worse when you're trying to find something comfortable too.  I measure that I should need a 10.5 EEE shoe.  I bought these in 11 / 6-E and I finally have some comfort !  So far I've worn them daily for 3 months and may have to replace the footbed inserts soon, but they have been the best boots I've worn in many years !"
"Bought these because they are one of the few ""wide"" shoes made with good ankle support. However, the design is not a good one for men with wide feet.  The tongue of the shoe is sewn to the sides (?), making it difficult to put the shoe on and uncomfortable across the top of the foot. It also is very narrow; I measured the sole of a size 11 6E against a pair of New Balance size 11D shoes and the difference in width was negligible.  The insole they put inside is actually too wide for the shoe itself.Just really bad execution of a great idea."
"Working a job where I'm on my feet for 90% of the time I needed a pair of boots that didn't kill my feet, and these are the ones I found after a long search. I can wear these boots all day and not have any pain which is a first for me. I actually prefer to wear these as my every day foot wear now because they're actually more comfortable than my regular shoes which is a mind blower. I wish they came in more colors though."
"Wide enough to fit comfortably. But just a little bigger than I need. The caveat: My feet are all kinds of chewed apart. My history includes: Paperboy, Baltimore, MD, from ages 8-14; Year-round athlete, ages 8-16; Landscaper, ages 13-18; Restaurant Staff, ages 16-19; Furniture Delivery/Truck Driver, ages 18- 25; Soldier, ages 25-34; Medical Staff, Multiple Services, ages 25-52 and beyond.......I think I need “specialized shoes” from now on. So, for my needs, EXCELLENT SHOE, over the counter. I need a prescription....... about 20 years ago.HU-AAAAAAAAHHHHHH.....................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?Thank you, New Balance, for the acknowledgment that WIDE FEET EXIST!!!!!!!Hello?....... EVERY other shoe brand - IN THE WORLD- !!!!!!!!  ?????PAY ATTENTION, dummy...!!!!"
"I'm happy with the purchase, though next time, I might go up to the 6E instead of sticking with the 4E version. They seem to run a little narrow for my taste. Otherwise...they're the real deal. I wear them to work and I pull 12 hour nights shifts at a hospital. I was looking for something that had really good support and were a good, solid, stable foundation to work off when moving patients. These do the trick."
Poorly manufactured.  We purchased for our grandson and after he wore them 2-3 times the ankle area of the inner left boot ripped after he tripped over a branch!  So disappointed with this boot because we have other New Balance shoes and encountered no problems.  I hope we can return because it says the return window is closed!
"The leather is very thing and fragile, There is a rubber label on the tongue that gets bunched up so I removed them. The tongue of the show has to be sort of crunched into the shoe.Fortunately I got these for $45 as a used/like new item so I am overall happy."
"I,purchased these primarily because of the new balance name.  I am GREATLY disappointed.  The soles of the boots have separated from the rest of the shoe and this happened within first 6months of almost daily use.  I can not believe how poorly manufactured these are especially with the New Balance Name."
Great except slippery on wet rocks packed snow and ice. Not a good winter sole
"Ich habe nur 4 Sterne von 5 vergeben, weil die Einlegesohle fest verklebt ist und orthopädische Einlagen nicht mehr in den Schuh passen. Ich habe schmale Füße und der Schuh hat mir perfekt gepaßt. Aber er muß 1 bis 1,5 Schuhgrößen größer bestellt werden. Das Obermaterial ist sehr weich und gut verarbeitet."
"Zapatilla muy comoda , yo las uso para pasear y son comodisimas tallan justas por lo que hay que pedir una talla mas , las recomiendo."
"Me han gustado mucho. Son iguales que en las fotos. Yo uso una talla 42 y he cogido una 43,5.me quedan un pelin más grande,  pero no se nota nada. Volvería a comprarlas. Su precio me ha encantado.super cómodas ."
Me encantan y muy buen precio
Perfectas
"Buenas sensaciones son muy comodas,la talla es correcta.cuando pase un tiempo si son duraderas y resistentes les dare cinco estrellas."
"Gute Passform, bequem, passt wie erwartet.Wird als Alltagsschuh genutzt."
"Muy cómodas! Y el tallaje bien. Quedan muy bien con la ropa, baratas y con calidad"
Perfect colour and good quality it's the best s
"Very fine, very good 👍 👍"
Adidas quality at it's best. I like the design and sole used in this shoe. My daughter uses it for when playing tennis and similarly with badminton. She feels the comfort and high quality that adidas is known for.
"It is difficult to get my fee into them and when I do, I feel like I have boats on."
Love this shoe.  Helps keep good balance while playing tennis.
Love ! Great foot stability!
"Shoes are comfortable, but they aren’t even 2 months old and the design of the shoe is causing the material at the ankle to fatigue. It bends every step I take. Disappointing."
Pensé que eran originales y de piel como los de adulto y me salieron clonados y de piel sintética.
"My kid burns through shoes pretty fast. I'm now adding Kswiss to the list of name brand shoes that just aren't made like they used to be. They survived about a month with medium wear. Do not recommend getting your 8 year old shoes that have cloth loops for laces. 2 of them ripped out and now my kid can't tie them up. Had to drill holes in them to use for the laces and a decent pair of school shoes are now play shoes. Nice try KSwiss, you can go sit on the bench with the sketchers & adidas. Guess we will stick with Nike & Puma for awhile."
"I'm a big fan of the ST329 by K-swiss.  I've had 8 or 9 pairs over the last 11 years.  My son asked if they make them in his size.  Well whaddya know, they do!On the first day of kindergarten, my big boy got to wear the most comfortable sneakers he's ever worn"
Grandson loves them .. They fit him very good.
"a bit too narrow, and or seems to run a bit small"
This is the second pair of these that I have purchased and my 13 year old loves them!
Awesome quality fit perfect my son loves them I would definitely buy again
Perfect my son loves them
Absolutely love
"Appena arrivate, un giorno prima del previsto.Scarpe puma bianco in tela, come descrizione.Le ho soltanto provato,ho comprato il numero 42 e  sembra essere taglia corretta.Non ci ho ancora camminato su, se dovessi riscontrare qualche difetto aggiornerò la recensione."
"Avevo aspettative molto alte sul prodotto . considerando le marca molto famosa nello sport, ma ho dovuto ricredermi. Qualita della plastica da migliorare, spero che riescano a resistere allo sport, considerando un assemblaggio non troppo perfetto."
"Klasse Produkt,macht was es soll.Qualität ist wie bei den anderen Rezessionen Top.Super schnelle Lieferung, bin sehr zufrieden.Puma spricht für sehr gute Qualität zum guten Preis"
"El tiempo dirá lo que me duran pero parecen robustas, sencillas y desde luego el precio es dificil de mejorar. Muy satisfecho."
Le scarpe sono ottime per un uso soft tipo camminate anche a passo spedito o per un uso quotidiano. Tengono abbastanza bene la pioggia. Sconsiglio l'uso di queste scarpe per correre o attività fisica più impegnative. Nel compleso rimane un valido prodotto.
Stanno benissimo….calzano bene..comode
Bellissima colore e robustezza unica pecca veste grande consiglio di acquistare una taglia in meno
"Schuh sehr schön, passt perfekt."
Muy suave  ...perfecto
It is very uncomfortable shoes - I doubt it’s organelle or notInfact will write to Puma to look into
Calidad esperada de una marca como Adidas. Súper cómodos.
Muy buena compra a un precio accesible
"I’ve had these shoes for about a month now and Really loving them! As far as I can tell these are legit Adidas! They are comfy and so cute. I’m not really a runner, I bought these shoes mostly for style but i gotta say I never realized how much a shoe matters in running until I bought these. Definitely good for running. They have like a honeycomb sole at the ball and heel of the shoe to lessen impact. Like I said super comfy!I have noticed the shoe lace issue some reviews mentioned but nothing a little double knot can’t fix.All in all, I love these shoes!!"
"I had a new pair of these and my college D1 athlete came home due to the quarantine - she’s a swimmer - suddenly turned runner, she swiped my shoes.  Took me a while to find the exact shoe but I did and now I have my running shoes back.  Very hard to purchase shoes when you can’t try them on.  These shoes have a soft upper that does not rub or irritate and they have a soft wide heel for the trail running I like.  They are a bit heavy but that is because the heel is solid.  The laces are a bit odd for a runner but once adjusted the upper combined with the shock absorption of the soul of the shoe makes it worth the time.  I have a narrow heel and it slips if not tied properly.  I am a size 10 and I have enough room in the toe for long runs."
"I was so excited to find one if my fav shoes in stock, since I'm pretty sure its been discontinued. Unfortunately, they arrived USED with some pretty gross looking unidentifiable crud on the bottom of the shoes. I uploaded pics but they don't really pic up the texture. My closest guesses to what was on the bottom is dried mud, paper mache, and spider webs. The shoe packing that normally goes inside new shoes was missing too. I'm so bummed I should've known it was too good to be true :("
"First of all I was so surprised how quickly these arrived considering the virus crisis, which says great things about this seller! I was really happy to get them so fast because I couldn’t really start my marathon training program until I had the shoes.As for the product itself,  this is my second pair of pure boost go, & they are great for long distance runs. Lots of cushion & my last pair didn’t give out on me until after 9 months of very heavy use. I’m still able to use my last pair  for waking & shorter runs (but can feel it in my feet & knees that they are on their way out) so I’m rotating the new pair in for the high mileage runs.I can recommend both seller & shoes"
Order 1/2 size down.  Absolutely one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased..
"Updated: after finally breaking these shoes in (it took longer than expected), I changed my review from 1 star to 4. I still think the ultra boosts are better and have an extra bounce but overall these shoes are quite comfortable and great for running and walking.Original review: I decided to try the pureboost for a walking shoe since I absolutely love my adidas ultraboosts (I have had six pairs for running). I assumed they would be similar but they are not at all. I wore them out for a 5 mile walk and they destroyed the back of my heel. The shoes are not comfortable. If you are between these and the ultraboosts i highly recommend spending the extra money to get the ultraboosts. They are the most comfortable running/walking shoe i have ever had and worth every penny."
This shoe was way too large. I have always ordered my running shoes a full size larger. Did the same with these shows but they were so large they looked like clown shoes. Sent them back immediately.
"Light weight shoe, but great shoe! Super comfortable for walking or running. Great for normal to wide feet. May run a half size bigger for skinny feet. Would recommend and purchase again!"
"Anni fa comprai le mizuno wave 17, ad dir poco eccezionali oltre che comode.Presi il numero 45 e mi trovai veramente bene.Oggi dopo tanti anni ho avevo deciso di prendere un paio nuovo,purtroppo mi sono reso conto che le 45 non mi vanno piu'... adesso ho negli anni le misurazioni delle scarpe sono cambiate, oppure mi è cresciuto il piede... pero' ho i miei dubbi che a 47 anni ci sia questa possibilità.Inoltre le scarpe sopra indicate, erano un po' durine, sul pavimento non avevano quella leggerezza che ricordavo.In ogni caso le ho restituite prendendo un altro modello della mizuno, ma stavolta il 46"
"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Ayant facilement des douleurs aux genoux, j'étais à la recherche d'une chaussure confortable et polyvalente à un prix abordable. Sur recommandation d'un collègue expert en la matière, j'ai choisi ce modèle et je dois dire que les premiers essais sont très intéressants !On a l'impression de chausser des pantoufles, très confortables même si l'épaisseur de la semelle sous le bout du pied semble très fine, on oublie ce détail en courant.L'arrière, bien plus épais, propose un très bon amorti mais qui reste stable pour autant. Elle est dynamique avec un arrondi qui fait gagner en confort. L'énergie se disperse bien.J'étais avant sur une chaussure à la semelle plate (hors grip) et la forme présente sur ce type de modèle représente un vrai agrément.On sent un peu l'effet ressort à chaque foulée et ça donne envie d'aller plus vite et plus loin.La pointure correspond aux autres marques, ne taille ni trop petit ni trop grand.Je recommande cette paire et si cet avis vous aide à vous décider, n'hésitez pas à cliquer sur le bouton utile ci dessous."
"Il prodotto è arrivato con un giorno di anticipo e perfettamente impacchettato. Da anni compro Mizuno Paradox ma non trovandole più al prezzo precedente, ho comprato questo modello. Provate oggi. Come desiderato le ho trovate molto antipronazione al punto che al momento ho deciso di non inserire le mie solette ortopediche. Spero che rispetto alle Paradox, siano un po’ più robuste sulla punta perché nonostante le abbia sempre rinforzate  con una pezza di cuoio leggero all’interno, in passato le ho sempre bucate  in 6 mesi"
Premetto che le ho prese perché felice possessore delle wave 3. Vengo da un paio di adidas troppo morbide che mi hanno frantumato un menisco. Queste sono abbastanza dure. Però a mio avviso sono brutte. Ci devo solo andare a correre per cui ci passo sopra.
"Chiaramente dipende da come calzano sul proprio piede, ma io che non sono una piuma ed ho la pianta del piede larga trovo che queste siano tra le migliori come calzabilità e stabilità che danno"
"Prodotto di ottima fattura, vestibilità nella norma. Aiuta la corsa per chi ha falcata da pronatore. Consigliato!"
"Misura giusta, ma sembrano più piccole del modello che avevo in precedenza."
"mi dovete scusare il pacco è arrivato, l'ìha prrso un mio vicino di casa, ma è tornato solo ora da lavoro e me 'lha portato, io non potevo sapere di questa cosa...son passate tre ore e che ne so...scusate tutto apposto"
"Mizuno Wave Equate 5, Scarpe per Jogging fantastiche e comodissime"
Sono comode e rapporto prezzo qualità è eccellente
"Great pair of sandals! Fit well exactly as expected, has an ""airy"" design and is very comfortable too."
"...if you have a high instep. Like many shoe companies now, Skechers skimps on Velcro, saving a fraction of a cent, but making the shoes unwearable unless you have low-profile feet. Yet at the same time, there's way more Velcro than would ever be needed on the heel strap.There are also prominent ridges across the sandals separating the toes from the rest of the foot, as well as another ridge between the large toe and the remaining toes. So, unless you have perfectly average feet, you may find those uncomfortable.The relaxed fit is a nice idea, just poorly executed in lacking sufficient Velcro."
Skechers is my favorite brand
"My son loves these shoes. They are comfortable and fit well. My son tends to be particular about how his shoes fit and he loves these. We have bought several pairs as he grows. He is on pair #3 just due to growing into bigger sizes. They seem to wear down as expected. He wears the shoes everyday and is rough on them, but they hold up. Over time they do start show some of the wear and tear, but not more than expected based on his use."
Second pair of these. They don’t scuff easy like some of the cheaper tennis shoes for toddlers. They are sturdy and fit well. Unfortunately the sole comes right out so if you have a kid that likes to take off their shoes you could find one sole mysteriously disappears during daycare one day. Under the sole is rock hard so you can’t continue wearing them unless you can find a similar replacement sole.
"Espectacular,son una pasada,me han encantado,de talla ideal,yo uso un 38 y me quedan bien,son super cómodas,yo me las he puesto con vaqueros y me chiflan como quedan,también tengo el modelo rapla en blanco,y espectacular también,estoy encantada con esta marca.Me las había recomendado una amiga y la verdad que las doy un 10."
Absolutely love these shoes for my toddler! My son is 3 and just outgrew his size 9 adidas shoes - i went for these because the price was right and i know he is comfy in this brand/style. Great buy and i know they will last well!
Me han encantado!! Superó mis expectativas! Muy contenta con la compra.Lo que si me las noto un pelin grandecitas
"I got these for my son as his first ""real"" shoes.  They were a great fit and stayed on very well.  He did not seem to mind these as much as he did his other baby shoes.  The color of these was nice and complimented a lot of things.  The Velcro worked well and held the shoes on even when he tried to pull them off.  The inside felt cushioned and the shoes were easy to bend."
"Preciosas me encantan y quedan super bien , comodísimas!, es el tercer par de esta marca y nunca decepcionaGracias Gioseppo 😍"
Great shoe. My infant girl wears a size 2 and it fits her perfectly and there is enough width for her foot to feel comfortable. The style is super cute too.
Kedan genial
My four year old has a few options in this brand and these are my favorites. They wipe down rather easy and are adorable. My child can get them on her feet and wears them without complaining.  I like that the coloring has a sweet feminine touch to it.  Packaging was great and they arrived quickly using Amazon Prime.
"Son muy cómodos, vienen bien de talla, y son mucho más guapos de lo que se ven en la foto"
Disappointed in these. Size runs very small and inside space where foot goes is very short. Also description says grey with hint of blue but they are grey and lilac purple. Returned.
Perfecto
I love this shoes.  They look so nice on my son and as others have commented they are so easy to keep clean!!! Even after spending time on the playground with dirt and mud ... a quick rinse and wipe and they look new.  I love them.
Quedan perfectos y muy buena calidad
I am so disappointed.These shoes aren’t cheap for a 2 year old and less than 1 month into use (we have 5 pairs of shoes we rotate use of regularly in the same size) the stitching at the toe has come undone and there is a big hole.
Me quedan perfectas
"My kid has pancake feet, so I really have to shop around to get his kicks just right. These are lightweight, comfortable, and not obnoxious. The price was fantastic as well. I would definitely buy these again in a different color."
Muy bien
"I wrote an earlier review giving these shoes 4 stars. I'm changing that to 2. I'm giving them a 2 because they are comfortable as walking shoes. The reason for the demotion is due to the mesh material they are subject to getting holes in them which is poor construction, so my earlier praise is gone. I was getting out of my car and bumped the door with my foot resulting in a small hole in the shoe at the toe. Nothing you can do to fix it. So now water comes in and you can see your foot or sock if white. I missed the return date by one day. Too much money to get holes in them. You shouldn't go around being afraid of your shoe getting holes. New Balance should know better and so should I."
"I wanted to try these and was a skosh wary because they're used, but desc says like new, and Amazon is the seller, so what could go wrong, right? Received in a FLASH! Wooo - got here in one day, and I put 'em on (with a shoe horn) and wore 'em to a meeting last night. Plenty confy, and they look pretty good.  My bride was surprised I'd buy blue shoes, let alone WEAR them!?!?! Stylin' R Me.As to used - one shoe has a crimp where the big toe goes, and a spot with what could be a very light stain. Bottoms don't look like they've been worn much. The crimp worried me, but I didn't feel it at all, and they're really ""grippy"" on the floors. So far, so good. And I can return 'em if something turns up. For $40 quite pleased."
"Longtime NB wearer, never had tried this particular style...given my longstanding history of being very pleased with NB (not to mention the price!) I bought them and have been fairly pleased.They are super comfy and possess all the aspects of NB that I have grown accustomed to...but they fit a little strange. Im a dude with a small-ish foot (size nine) but that usually is a perfect fit with NB, but these arrived and they seem to run a little big, my foot slides around a bit more in these than other NB shoes for some reason. I dunno. I like em enough (i work as a nurse) so being on my feet for 12 hours a shift they are still super comfortable and I've just gotten used to the larger fitting size."
I was looking for a comfortable show that can be worn around the house and for short trips to the market or shops. This one is perfect. Very comfortable sole and structure. Does not fell sloppy and holds foot firmly but gently in place. New Balance makes great shoes and these are no exception. Very good quality and all the details are properly done.
Description of width was confusing requiring me to buy at a slightly higher price with free return.  Width is fine and comparatively easy to make small adjustments using laces.
Shoe specified slip on construction. Maybe I am too literal but I thought this meant the shoe just slipped on and did not have laces to tie. The picture made it look similar to other shoes that have the lace look but no actual shoe lace to tie. This is not the case. I am sure these are perfectly fine sneaker but not for someone who does not have the dexterity to ties a shoe.
"Not quite as wide as I expected for a wide, and it’s difficult getting my feet into because the opening is a bit small, but once they’re on, omg are these shoes comfortable!  It’s like wearing supportive slippers that are socially acceptable.  My feet are very grateful I bought these!"
"The material at the toe of the shoe is very loose and stretchy.  As I ran, my feet from my arch forward felt too loose.  In fact, my toes crept forward over the outline of the sole of the shoe and were making contact with the ground with only the mesh as a barrier.  Tightening my laces did not help the issue.  For me, these shoes are useless for any type of exercise.  They've already been demoted to dog walking shoes (in this new role, they do fine)."
Great running shoe - only annoying thing is the shoelaces come untied when running. Get a new pair of laces or double knot
"I love Amazon for shoes my size (15D).  New Balance always fits me well, and these were priced so well I had to get a pair.  These shoes are perfect!"
"Pensavo che stavo acquistando i soliti stivaletti ma la fattura e i materiali mi hanno lasciato senza parole. Sono ""tecnici"" ma allo stesso tempo eleganti senza tempo. Non temono freddo e pioggia. Comodissimi. Cercate di chiuderle così che la cerniera non dia fastidio. Dopo qualche volta capirete come vi vestono meglio."
"La scarpa è molto bella, purtroppo mi è arrivata un numero più grande e la confezione lasciava molto a desiderare. Unica cosa positiva il prezzo scontato."
"Hacemos un pedido del 44,5; llega un 46. Al tramitar cambio, el precio se dispara."
scarpa calda con il freddo e con pioggia piede asciutto.
"Absolutely waterproof, and stylish....perfect combination.  Got caught in a downpour and feet were loving the dryness.  Jeans were soaked but feet/socks were perfectly dry.  Great product."
"Ich habe die Schuhe für meinen Sohn für die Grundschule gekauft. Sie passen wie erwartet und haben einen schönen Sitz. Es war mir wichtig, dass sie nicht rutschen, da Kinder ja gerne auch mal herumlaufen.Mein Sohn findet sie sehr bequem und trägt sie gerne!"
"Ich habe meinem Sohne die Schuhe für die Schule gekauft und was soll ich sagen, bin wie jedes mal super zufrieden. Ist schon das 3 paar Schuhe von der Marke und mein 2 Sohn kann sie später dann auch noch anziehen, da sie wirklich robust sind und nicht so schnell kaputt gehen. Klare Kaufempfehlung meinerseits."
"Schnell an- und ausziehen, sind bequem und unserem 1.Klässler gefallen sie auch. Die Hausschuhe von Superfit halten bei uns immer ewig. Auch bei täglicher und extremer Nutzung!"
Schöne bequeme schuhe für meinen sohn.Die schuhe passen wie angegossen. Die sehen auch cool aus. Wir sind sehr zufrieden. Bei  superfit kann man nichts falsch machen.
"Endlich einen Hausschuh für Jungs gefunden, der weder Fußball- noch Monstermotive hat.Mein Sohn trägt ihn gerne."
"Trotz Messen waren die Schuhe leider zu groß. Dennoch werden sie NICHT zurückgeschickt.Die Schuhe sind sehr gut verarbeitet und sehen toll aus.Sie warten nun im Schrank auf ihren Einsatz.Würde sie jeder Zeit wieder kaufen, wenn auch eine Nr. kleiner, als empfohlen wird."
Come sempre una garanzia
"Gute Passform bei breitem Fuß.Robust, wird im Kindergarten getragen. Bisher das dritte Modell von Superfit Bill welches wir gekauft haben. Waren immer zufrieden."
"Wir wählen immer wieder Hausschuhe dieser Marke, die mögen die Kinder und die Sohle ist relativ flexibel"
"Guter Sitz, Klett hält gut und hat einen sicheren Halt, perfekt für den Kindergarten!"
Günstig
"Absolut spitze in Qualität, Passform und Design"

Did not like that these shoes felt really hard in the arch area. Definitely not a fan.
Best gym shoe for walking and standing for long periods of time
Shoes are nice and comfortable. I use them as walking shoes
Have received lots of compliments. Good fit and comfortable
Love them! Great style and the memory foam was a plus.
excellent tennis !!
Der Stoff an der Jacke löst sich leider schnell ab.
Leider doch zu schmal für den Fuss  meiner Mutter. Geht leider zurück.
Der Schuh hat eine tolle Farbe und ist bequem. Trage ihn sehr gerne.
gute Trageform
Passt super.

"son las zapatillas de mi vida, tanto que las he comprado en dos colores, talla correcta, hiper cómoda, no pesan y son altas, soy feliz con ellas"
"Die Lieferung erfolgte wie immer kurzfristig, die Sneaker sehen auch wirklich schön aus, nur leider sind sie mir zu klein und eng. Gegen daher zurück."
"Die Form und die Passform super, mit dem Schuh geht man sehr gut, die Farbe ist auch toll, bin sehr zufrieden damit!"
"me requete encantan, talla correcta, color intenso, extra cómodas, voy por el segundo par"

Sehr leichter und bequemer Schuh.
"perlweiß und leicht schimmernd. Also nichts für mich. Aber sehr schöne Schuhe, aus Leder, ähnlich Hogan"

"After this purchase I'm not sure I'll purchase another pair of adidas with this pair being my first. The sneakers fit weird, as in the sizing. I am a 10 1/2- 11 in women. I has to order the sneaker three times and just gave up or in with a size 8 men. The sole has nice cushion, but the toes area doesn't as much like the sneaker has an incline making it uncomfortable to walk in for a long period of time. The style and colors I love. Hope I didn't confuse anyone maybe if it was in women sizes the fit would have been some what better but then again the sole is weird."
"Okay, Truth be told.. Originally found these Ultra Cool Adidas Ninja shoes at the 'Adidas Outlet Store"" in Cabazon, CA. HOWEVER, They did NOT have my correct size & were not able to ever get again. So, looked for lowest price all over the Internet. Was happy to find on Amazon for a decent price & did not get upset considering the $88.00 cost at Outlet Store... All I can say is  Thank You!  They fit Perfectly!  Very comfortable & snug as a glove. Great Color too!!  Peace & 💖 Andrew J.😊"
My husband had to have them for today and they arrived yesterday otherwise I would have returned them. They were very clearly a return as they were dirty inside including hair and one of the soles were out halfway and are super sticky on the underside so they are not supposed to be removed.
"Right from the get go put them on and wore them 8 hours. Even better than that orange/blue of the 2x foam I wear at work. If your knees are going out, like my knees, they are the shoes to wear.Adidas always seems to be a true fit for me , wearing a 9.5"
Fits bigger than the other 4 pairs of Adidas mens 10s I own. Seems about a half size bigger. Love the appearance but one part of the hot pink is coming unglued after 2 days of wear.
Super comfortable kicks and they look Awesome.
"There are no dislikes, every step is with cushion like feel. These have become my favorites."
I never had shoes this comfy. Definitely buy another pair.
Walking on clouds.
"I very highly recommend the Morrison3 sneaker. These fit great and true to size. They are comfortable and I like that they ""breathe"". I have had these in several colors and I am always thinking of additional colors that I would like to purchase."

"I purchased these for the rocker sole to help with Hallus Rigidus, swapped out the insole for my custom orthotic and tried them on.  They were quite snug.  I assumed (my first mistake) that they would stretch, and wearing them around the house for a bit with the tags on they did seem to loosen.  So off came the tags and I wore them out.Unfortunately that tiny bit was all they stretched and they remained far too tight across the vamp.  In particular, the liner crosses over the top of the foot under the elastic and forms a painful pressure point.  Since I now had $140 of unreturnable shoe, I preformed shoe surgery and removed the stitching across the top in that section. This let the liner stretch slightly, but not enough.  Even in my older, thinner orthotics and trouser socks, the pressure point remains when you wear them for any length of time.  I may yet perform more surgery to remove the liner from the toe area, because they are unusable for me in their current fit.Clark shoes run a bit small and narrow, in my experience, so I ordered half a size up and regular instead of narrow width.  This portion fit as expected.  If you do not need to swap out the insoles and so not need lateral support, these shoes might work for you.  The rocker sole does help with mild toe arthritis; severe cases will want to look for a stiffer sole than these.TL;DR -- don't buy if you wear custom orthotics, don't buy if you pronate, don't believe they will stretch when you try them on."
These shoes felt a little snug when I first got them. I wore them around the house to make sure they were a good fit. I decided to take a chance on them and wear them the whole next day. They really adjusted well to my feet and I am pleased. I like that you can order Clark’s in a wide.
"I have a narrow foot and Clark's usually fit perfectly, but these are tight and not adjustable because of the elastic band.  Super cute and well made."
Too small so it feels too narrow
"☆☆☆Want it Short and sweet???OK,LEATHER QUALITY:  EXCELLENTSOLE QUALITY: EXCELLENTLINING QUALITY:  VERY GOODDESIGN AND LOOKS:  VERY GOODBANG FOR THE BUCK:  VERY LOUD......!DURABILITY:  IT'S A HUSH PUPPIESI HAVE 4 PAIRS OF  HUSH PUPPIES, and have been wearing them for 3 years.  They will last 7 more years. No Problem."
"One of the eyelets came off, the first time I laced the shoes.  There is a flaw in the design. Poor quality."
Cool boots
The sole came detached after wearing these for 2 days only.
"Schuhe sind wie zu erwarten bequem und haben eine tolle Passform. Sind auch ziemlich leicht, also perfekt zum Sport machen. Die Farbe des Schuhe ist auch mit der Abbildung übereinstimmend. Einen Minuspunkt gibt es zur Pflege, da die Schuhe sehr schnell stark verschmutzen, leiht aber generell am Material."
"Ich bin eigentlich überhaupt kein Fan von Turnschuhen - sie sehen mir einfach immer viel zu klobig aus und unschön.Aber diese hier sehen super schön aus, sind mega bequem und stehen mir sehr gut."
"Ja, die Schuhe passen, sind aber nicht so schön wie andere KangaROOS die ich besitze.Ziemlich klobiges Design, Preis war aber okay. Sehr empfindliches Obermaterial."
Ich war mit allem sehr zufrieden und habe nichts zu beanstanden.
👍
tolle Preisleitung!!!schuhe passen gut man läuft prima drin und sie sind auch nicht empfindlich.bin Rundum zufrieden!
Für den Preis sehr gute Schuhe und bequem zu tragen

"Just received these shoes today, it was delivered earlier than usual. I have small feet a size 5 or 5.5 so I ordered a size 6. It was still tight so I am returning but what realllly bothered me was that it’s yellow on parts of the shoe? Don’t like that at all looks dirty already."
"I absolutely love these shoes! I've ordered 3 different pairs and wear them all the time! I prefer the canvas ones to the other kinds, they just feel a bit more comfortable. I'm on my feet almost all day and they never hurt when wearing these. I usually wear a 7 or 7.5 and these got perfectly."
"I usually wear a 7.5 or 8 tops so I ordered an 8.5 as the reviews suggested, and they fit perfectly. They are also thin like people say but I have skies for feet so wasn't a problem for me. Not the comfiest but they look awesome. They are for show not going on hikes lol. White is really crisp. Got what I expected after the reviews and at this price point."
"Stark white sneakers will pretty much pull together any outfit - resulting in a classic, casual and effortless vibe.They are a must-have in my shoe collection. I prefer to re-buy cheap white fashion sneakers as white, well... doesn’t really keep it’s “white-out white” for very long.These shoes hold up very well. I use them strictly for fashion purposes, and are comfortable for that purpose."
A little bit more sparkly than I was expecting... the photo of the rose gold lurex didn't look sparkly to me in the picture but that's okay because they're still cute. I'm usually an 8.5 so I ordered an 8.5 and they fit perfectly.
"Love these shoes... They are a bit to big, would recommand half a point under, but I've correct it by adding a sole and they are perfect for work! Confortable and chic. Note that they are very shinny, but I didn't mind they look great with jeans."
"I was unable to get the shoes on, they were so narrow, althoughI had ordered in my regular size.I would not recommend  this product"
"They look great, just what I needed. I feel like they really need a cushioned insole or are uncomfortable, and they were a bit on the bigger side, but that is an easy fix."
"Very cute shoe. Fits a bit on the smaller side, would recommend ordering a half size up. For the price the product is good however the shoe has lower breathability compared to other brands, which makes it a good shoe for fashion but not if you are going out / walking for a long time."
"Love these, and the silver so sparkles,  unique,  bling bling.Comfortable and lightweight"
Muy buenos tenis
"The shoes were great but the box was completely destroyed. When I ordered the shoe it was from Adidas (Harden Vol 4), however it said in my order history that the shoe was Adidas Men’s Crazy X 4 and it was sold by Shoe Cago. I was so confused and thought I was scammed. When I received the shoe I was expecting it to be some other adidas shoes but it turned out to be the Harden Vol 4. After doing research I found out that some other companies called the Harden Vol 4 “Crazy X 4”. I checked the shoes and they’re legit Harden Vol 4 but still they should fix this and make it clear if this is sold by Adidas or Shoe Cago and fix the name."
"Muy comodas, gran calidad, tienen buen ajuste, originales definitivamente."
These shoes fit great and are stylish. Great purchase @
"No se ve muy bien puesto, es muy ancho,se  ve mal"
Great color
Awesome shoes look great quick to ship!
I needed 1/2 size bigger I think. Really love the look.
"Bought it for my son, apparently there the current rage, good shoe but wish the made high tops"
Bad quality
El color es increíble la talla es un poco justaSi eres de pie gordo no te lo recomiendo ya q  lo sentirás muy ajustado y se deforma muy feoEn general buen tenisTiempo de entrega super rápido
"Muy buenos tennis, le han aguantado a la persona que se los regale... Si los recomiendo."

J’ai racheté une paire plus grande et c’est parfait. Par contre j’ai retourné la paire trop petite et a ce jour je n’ai pas été rembourser encore. Alors je suis déçu
Very nice I always buy stretches very comfortable and I like it.

I have found them very comfortable.
tres satisfaite du produit.. Merci
"Super cute, and very comfy.  My only complaint is I can not get my foot in with the tongue of the shoe getting pushed all the way up to the toe.  Thinking about trying to glue it down."
"Zunächst vorneweg, der Schuh ist super, passt wie erwartet und ist komfortabel und schick. Verarbeitungsqualität lässt keine Wünsche offen. D.h. der Schuh selbst verdient keine 1-Stern Bewertung, aber man kann nur das Produkt bewerten und nicht das Kauferlebnis selbst. Das ist ja grundsätzlich bei Amazon hervorragend und ich bezeichne mich selbst eher als Amazon-Junkie als Amazon-Kunde, aber was diesmal mit der Prime-Wardrobe Bestellung passiert ist, ist denke ich eine Rezension wert, denn das geht gar nicht, weiß nicht so recht wo der Fehler ist, das muss Amazon versuchen zu lösen. Folgendes ist passiert: Sehe den Schuh zum sensationellen Preis von 79 EUR (bei Zalando war er deutlich teurer) und lege ihn in den Warenkorb. Es wurde mir angeboten direkt zu dem Preis zu kaufen oder in Wardrobe zu dem Preise zur Anprobe. Denke mir nichts und lege ihn in Wardrobe, könnt ja sein, dass er nicht passt, also nutze ich doch den komfortablen „Zur-Probe Bestellweg“. Schwups bestellt und bekomme per Mail die Bestätigung, aber ohne Preis (0,00 EUR wurde abgebucht) steht da nur in der Bestätigung, denke mir nichts, denn habe ja für 79 EUR in den Warenkorb gelegt, also wird es schon passen. Drücke nochmal auf den Artikel und sehe Preis liegt jetzt bei 87 EUR, ok denke ich, da habe ich ja nochmals Glück gehabt und einen richtig guten Preis bekommen. Denkste! Heute Schuh bekommen, passt perfekt, also gleich ins Amazon-Konto und Schuh behalten drücken, aber was steht da. Schuh für 87 EUR kaufen oder zurückschicken. Hmm, aber ich habe doch für 79 EUR in den Warenkorb gelegt und bestellt. Aber nirgends ist ein Beweis dafür zu finden. Im Kundenkonto steht 87 EUR und in der Bestätigungsmail kein Preis. Habe das doch nicht geträumt, also Kundenservice angerufen, aber nichts zu machen. Ich kann gerne zurückschicken, die 87 EUR ist der Preis. Ok, das war kein besonders gutes Kauferlebnis, muss ich jetzt die Preise abfotografieren nach der Bestellung. Na egal habe den Schuh trotzdem bezahlt, er war auch mit 87 EUR sehr günstig, aber ähnlich Zalando (89 EUR) was aber gar nicht entscheidend ist wegen ein paar EUR mehr oder weniger. Aber sehr unbefriedigend ist schon, das man Artikel zu einem bestimmten Preis in den Warenkorb legt und dann offensichtlich ohne es zu merken oder den Preis bestätigt zu bekommen zu einem anderen Preis bestellt bzw. dann den Kauf abschließen muss. Das geht so nicht! Habe definitiv beim Abschicken der Bestellung (Knopf jetzt Bestellen) den Preis von 79 EUR angezeigt bekommen und erwarte dann auch, dass ich zu dem Preis kaufe und kein anderer, auch wenn Preise „im Hintergrund“ schwanken. Aus meiner Sicht ein Fehler im System und für mich ein Grund Wardrobe nicht zu nutzen. Also Vorsicht beim Bestellen über Wardrobe! Keine Ahnung ob ich ein Einzelfall bin oder andere auch schon diese Erfahrung gemacht haben, definitiv muss Amazon aber hier am System nachbessern."
"No es la primera vez que compro zapatos de esta marca, pero estos llegaron en una caja distinta, no de la marca, una caja de amazon y sucio uno de los tenis, como que  usaron 1 o 2 veces, se notaba que pisaron con el."
"Es sind schöne Schuhe, die auch sehr wertig Aussehen und sich nach dem Eintragen gut anfühlen.Leider ist vor kurzem eine Naht geplatzt und damit auch gleich der Schuh offen.Keine zusätzliche Verleimung etc. sondern die EINFACH GENÄHTE ""ZIERNAHT"" ist, an dieser Stelle, alles was den Schuh zusammenhält.Sie sehen Wertig aus, ohne wirklich Substanz dahinter zu haben. Ich werde mich wohl nach einem Schuh, made in EU umschauen."
"Bonitos cómodo y amplio, pedir talla habitual de zapatos"
Bin immer sehr skeptisch bei Schuhen online bestellen. Aber dieser: reingeschlüpft und fast wie angefertigt.Auch das Laufen ist sehr sehr gut. Absolut zu empfehlen!!!
Zufrieden
Die Füße schwitzen darin. Luft undurchlässig. Keine Empfehlung
Beautiful “I wear size is 9 base on the chart size I take 8.5 but the material the rubber soles are too hard in general the whole material
Zum Top - Preis - super Schuhe.

"Guter Tragecomfort auch bei längerem Spaziergang, gute Qualität, kann Ich nur weiter empfehlen!"
I like the design. The size is bigger than expected. The price is fluctuated by color and sizes and time that the order is made.
Top Qualität super Schuh passt super zum Anzug !
"Small wide, they are very thin"
Dieser Schuh fallt eher kleiner ausIst für Schlange Füße eher geeignet...Die Sohle ist eher etwas härter das sich im Tragekomfort negativ auslegt
These shoes was perfect for my Ck outfit..went very well. They were cute and different. Everyone love them..asked where I get them ftom
Die Schuhe wurden super schnell geliefert und sitzen super. Qualität richtig gut.
I love them
In liked the appearance and material of the shoes.
Disappointed that the shoe didn’t fit
Danke schön +++
"First off, I didn't need these shoes. But as they offered a stylish upgrade at an excellent price, I couldn't say no.As I do with any pair of Clark's, I ordered a half size smaller than my normal size and these fit perfectly. Plus, they're well-made, comfortable, and versatile enough that I can wear them with jeans or a suit. And did I mention the price was a steal?If you need to up your shoe game for a budget-friendly price, this is the pair of shoes to do it!"
I ordered this in tan to replace a shoe I ordered in a size 11.  The size 11 shoe was tan.  This shoe from this seller in a 10 1/2 is BROWN.  there is a distinct color difference.  Did not bother to send back.  These shoes run about half a size too big.  Waste of money for me this time.
Size way down. Stunning shoes but I normally wear a 10 and the 9 1/2 fit like an 11. I might try a 9 if they come back on sale again. I would have left 5 stars if the fit was better.
"I purchased these for my husband because his dress shoes were old and ugly and dated. They are classy, they are comfortable and he looks way more modern."
The shipping was very bad! The shoes box was ruined completely.
This style will never get old
It is very nice and well made. If you are thinking about buying it then do it! you will have no regrets.
The shoe looks feels and  fits great!!!
Nice solid yet flexible shoe. Great support.
Did not fit.
"Written this before but it always bears repeating: I. HATE. These kinds of reviews.They're loafer style sneakers. They're black loafer style sneakers. They're a nothing fancy wardrobe mainstay that you really don't think about much. They wear out and you get new ones so, what in the heck can you say other than that? Lol.Design-wise, they were smart and put in a scant little inch in the heel. An inch isn't noticeable in the slightest- you don't even conciously feel it but, when you have a tendon problem in your foot or heel... OMFG does that little inch make all the difference!!!The designer was also thoughtful enough to make the interior sole ever so slightly fuzzy. Anyone who has *ever* gone without socks in warm weather (pretty common to do in this style of shoe) know why that's a nice detail that is sadly lacking in a surprising number of shoes.I know that doesn't bother a lot of women because they have forced themselves to get used to it but those hard interiors that make the inside all icky gross the *instant* your body even *thinks* about sweating drive me bonkers. Lol.Maybe it's the 110F summers where I live but whatever the reason, I am always grateful for an all cloth interior for an enclosed shoe. Lol.Anyway, there wasn't any breaking in for me on these. Another nice touch. I was able to wear them straight out of the box as if I had them for years.On the other side of things, they also seem to be wearing quite well.So, yeah, they don't look like anything special and, I guess in a way, they're kind of not but, they're nicely put together enough that you *don't* really think about them. Well, at least, you don't unless you're sitting in front of a blank Amazon Review screen which, for me at least, proves that they're actually a nice product that probably won't get nearly the reviews that they probably should. ;)"
"Everyone is being nice and saying ""These run small, haha!"" but I just ordered a size 8 and it doesn't even fit my sister who usually wears a 6. Same story with the other pair of shoes I bought from this brand. This isn't just running small, this is inaccurate sizing. Shoes aren't like clothes, I know i have to be careful when i order pants or shirts because sizes can vary. But in every other store on the planet earth I wear a size 8 (US). This is just inexcusable honestly. Instead of expecting shoppers to order one size up, how about you just measure the actual shoes and send them the right size?"
"These shoes are awesome! I have wide feet and have been wearing Sketchers that never fit quit right, so decided to try these. Best fit I’ve ever had. They are made MUCH better. I ordered 8W.  Other shoes I’ve even tried 8WW, but these are perfect.  Wish I could find white ones. Love them!"
Even wide the toe band is way narrow.Other than that they're comfy.Very well made.
"Love these due to that they are so comfortable, and easy to slip into. I got them in black & then ordered them in blue. I ordered my regular size."
Finally bought inexpensive narrow shoes.  Didn’t really care for color but wanted comfortable fit.  These shoes are definitely perfect in that requirement!
"Lifestride shoes caught my eye on sale in a physical shoe store but selection was very limited so I hoped to find them similarly priced online. My usual size (9.5) felt a rather snug, not necessarily uncomfortable short term but I could not guess we'll enough what it would cause during longer wear. They seem to advertise having some kind of special arch support.. I'm not blown away by that, having said that I don't feel my feet fatigue either soo.. I guess thats working?On here I chose to go to a size 10 ""narrow"" just in case 9.5 really was too snug. I'm happy I did. The nose seems a little long but is just perfect while walking around. I have weirdly narrow long feet that also tend to get ugly gaps with low cut shoes. I still have some gaping but it isn't triggering me as much as it normally would. The shoe cups and forms nicely around my feet (no slipping off my heel yay!) and the leather is very soft. They're absolutely worth a try."
Shoes were better than I expected. Shoe fit true to size and had a great cushion at the bottom for support! Love and would buy again.
"Produit arrivé une dizaine de jours avant la date prévue, en super bon état et soigneusement emballé (chaque support emballé individuellement dans son papier). Vraiment satisfaite de mon achat."
Parfait
Son muy funcionales
buen producto. solo que no incluye los taquetes. pero si los tornillos.
Muy bueno
Todo en orden grxs
"Love these! I ordered a 5 pack to keep my kids balls off the ground and looking a little more pottery Barn. In fact I got the idea from pittry barn! We live them, are using them all. They even hold the kids football helmets. Super cute, very strong and live that the cone with drywall screws too!!"
"Used these to make a memorial board for my uncle who was also a coach. The rings are very sturdy and look great. The balls also sit in them well without falling. However, screws that come with them are cheap. The drill striped the screws before they were driven even half way in resulting in a late night Wal-Mart run. Not a deal breaker but might be helpful info."
"We bought these to hold our sons' basketballs so that they weren't always rolling around on the floor in our garage. These are definitely suitable for displaying a ""trophy"" ball in a bedroom on the wall but we just wanted an inexpensive solution for our garage and these fit the bill. We mounted these on a stud in the garage so they are very sturdy but still not meant for a lot of weight; even more so if you were to mount them on an inside sheet rock wall, even with wall anchors, these are only meant for supporting the weight of ball, not much more."
"These are exactly what I was looking for - a minimalist way of storing mini basketballs. The are super simple to install and look great. Perfect size for what I needed. For the price I do recommend them. I did not use the anchors that came with them and instead used my own that were better for my walls. Only 1 star deducted because one of them broke (see pic) after 8 months of use. It's not a big deal because I'm only using 3 and the package came with 5, so I just unscrewed the base of the broken one and installed one of the leftovers."
Bella sneakers e soprattutto ottimo prezzo! I miei figli calzano da sempre primigi per cui sulla misura sono andata sul sicuro.
I dig these shoes.  The color is great and slightly unique so you don't look like everyone else. Plus they are very comfortable which is a bonus.
Nice look and very comfortable.  I wear them all day in the office and have zero issues.
It runs have size bigger
"High quality, lovely looking and very comfortable.Will order more from Bugatti shoes, I like the fact that size of all their shoes is constant."
"Ich wusste, was ich kaufe und es war drin, was ich haben wollte."
Super Schuhe
"I want to love these. They are very cushioned, like you are on foam springs and they look amazing, but that's it. I feel like I can slip out of them or roll an ankle. The shoe material is so stretchy, it feels like a child's craft foam fabric which is great if you want light weight but seller is wrong to classify this as a cross-trainer. It is for running IF that, maybe just a pretty house slipper. Also I have narrow feet but this is for people with like 2D feet. Squishes down  from top to sole not width. I usually fit size 9, these were 9.5.Was going to return them but I do love how they look and they are comfy, just not for any athletic."
"I admit I bought these shoes because they look so cool and I've always loved Reebok's comfort.  And when I first put them on, I loved them.  But after walking around the house for an hour or so, they felt so tight!  The fabric really didn't stretch even as much as leather might.  I bought an 8 1/2, which is 1/2 size larger than I normally buy, so I didn't feel comfortable moving to a 9.  It wasn't the length that was the problem; they were just too inflexible.  Sadly, I sent them back."
These shoes look great and I enjoy the lack shoe laces but.....when I get to doing a fast pace walk or an incline walk I feel like I'm walking at am angle. Like I'm about to roll my ankle. I think I'm going to stick to my other athletic shoes for workouts. These are still cute for around town though.
"First of all, I love the design!Secondly, the comfortness is great. Soles are bouncy and the sneakers overall is very light.My size 7.5 US women and 39 as Europe women sizeI have been using for about two weeks, therefore I can not tell if they are long-lasting or not. But hopefully, they will last for about 2-3 years. Because I love the design and texture of the sneakers so much.The color white get dirty easily, so not recommend to run on rainy day.And $50 for this cool pair of sneakers... I must say it is a pretty nice price. Running shoes have become quite expensive recently and price range are usually from $60 or above."
They are very comfortable and fit as expected. For use around the house they are ok. These are not for cross training. The material is like neoprene and when working out or walking outside on slanted ground your foot slides all over.
"These are so comfortable and flexible.  I wear between an11 and 12, I ordered the 11 and after I broke them in they are wonderful.  No blisters,  no problems.  And I absolutely love the style,  they look amazing."
I like the way they look and they are comfortable.. however with the way the sole is it makes it very easy to roll ankles if you have weak ankles and they are not breathable.
The shoes' stretchy material makes them tough to walk down hills with as I feel like my foot is going to fall out through the toe area. Otherwise they are comfy and it feels like I'm walking on clouds.
I think they run small or I didn't size myself correctly but it's a hard to tell because the material of the toe of the shoe is so stretchy that what seemed OK at home and was comfortable actually wasn't when I went out on the trail. It's great not to have to tie untie these shoes and they keep their shape.
These shoes are really good for runners. The support for my arch has been amazing! I will be purchasing another pair
"Been wearing ours for less than a month, and during Virtual learning, and they are a mess! We don’t really go places very often and they are wrecked."
I know my 7yo plays hard but I expect the shoes to last more than two months! The front piece is almost dangling off and under that it looks like the mesh will rip. I like the fit of the Adidas but I think we are going back to Nike for durability.
"For the price, you can't beat them! Our son loves them, and he is picky about shoes."
excelent soft good thanks
Would order again great quality
Picture shows good but in reality it looks ok and does not looks appealing. I would skip this
Greta shoes and my son loves them. Unfortunately they run narrow.
Look great. Good value. They run slightly small.
Fits perfectly.
My kid loved the shoes easy to put on and light and fast
Ich liebe diese Farben von dem Sneaker - außerdem passt er wie angegossen und es läuft sich herrlich darin! Love it!
"Schöner Schuh, angenehm zu tragen. Passt super zu meiner Garderobe."

Passt gut
"Sono scarpe comodissime ideali per chi cammina molto. Per me sono ideali nelle stagioni fredde o medio fredde e direi anche in primavera. Esteticamente sono stupende, mi ricordano un modello che avevo da ragazzo con questi colori spettacolari."
Ho reso il prodotto solo per la taglia troppo grande. Il prodotto è molto bello. Il venditore è stato molto gentile e collaborativo nella fase di reso. Venditore consigliatissimo. Alla prossima. Grazie. Renato
"Schuhe kamen nach wenigen Tagen originalverpackt an. Die Farben sehen in Echt viel schöner und wertiger aus, als auf sämtlichen Fotos im Netz. Ein hervorragender, bequemer Stadt-Sneaker. Fast schon edel-cool. Diadora, bitte weiter so."
Molto comode e carine. PERÒ la prima volta che ho provate a lavarle con una spugna bagnata (acqua tiepida) è successo il patatrack..perdevano colore come se le avessi accoltellate.. peccato mi piacevano.Servizio clienti Amazon top! Reso approvato.
"Non ho nulla da aggiungere, per la mia esperienza è andato tutto bene."
"Stile vintage ma non troppo. Sono cmq soddisfatto. Calzano un po' grandi, ma sono comode."
Ho comprato questo articolo in quanto ho già il modello giallo e ritengo che il rapporto qualità prezzo sia ottimo.Spedizione veloce e prodotto perfetto.
Prodotto conforme alle aspettative consegna puntuale
Bella come da foto . Giornaliera
"La parte in punta è in pelle mentre dalla foto del prodotto sembrava essere in tela,.... comunque nel complesso  direi ok sia per comodità che estetica."
"Perfectas para una señora mayor que sale a caminar , muy cómodas y frescas. como dato curioso, el envío muy rápido, es la primera vez que Amazon me entrega un pedido en domingo."
Taglia sbagliata 😑 più piccole di quello che dovevano essere

Schuh wie in Abbildung erhalten. Die Sohle ist wie in Plateau hoch aber stört nicht wenn man es mag. Läuft sich gut!
Grösse trifft zu. Sehr bequem auch für breite Füße.
"ATENCIÓN: En mi experiencia soy Fan de la marca puma, siempre compro mi número 9 y me quedan perfecto, pero en este modelo en especifico una vez compre en nueve y por el corte me quedaron super justos, yo recomiendo comprar un medio número más a lo que están acostumbrados. De ahí a más, los tenis están hermosos, los materiales, los acabados, en fin, los recomiendo, como siempre llegaron antes de tiempo, recomiendo las compras por Amazon, excelente atención y servicio. Gracias México!"
"La horma es algo justa. Tengo el pie delgada y me quedo exacto el número que pedí. Ya había leído comentarios dónde mencionan que la horma viene justa y si es cierto, por eso contemplé un número más grande de lo habitual para mí. No me quedaron olgados pero tampoco apretados"
"Soy 8 y pedí 8 1/2 , de lo largo quedo bien, el tema es que esta muy estrecho y justo en el empalme. Los tengo que usar sin calcetines, y aun así me aprietan."
"Entiendo que es un modelo bajo lo o que lo vuelve reducido en tamaño es por eso qur los pedí en 30,00 ya que mi talla es 29,5 pero la diferencia en tamaño es mínima. Me quedan demasiado justos"
Excelente diseño y acabados de primera

La comodidad
Super comfy. I love puma shoes. Great style too. Check them out!!!
This shoe is so cute with skinny leg jeans. I was not too thrilled with the inner sole because there really isn’t one. Inside feels unfinished to the bare foot. I plan to purchase some inner soles to give this shoe a more completed feel.
Son perfectos. Volvería a comprar.
"Están hermosos,  delicados..."
"Da wir in keinem Geschäft unserer Stadt noch irgendwelche Gummistiefel für unsere Tochter gefunden haben, weil ihre Größe schlicht und einfach ständig ausverkauft war, haben wir uns entschlossen, nun hier welche zu bestellen und sind wirklich vollkommen zufrieden.Die Gummistiefel sind gut verarbeitet und vor allem wasserdicht, sie passen perfekt und trotzdem bieten sie noch genug Platz für dicke Socken an kälteren Tagen. Zudem sehen sie wirklich schick aus und sind auch von der Verarbeitung her wirklich in Ordnung.Ebenso fand ich den Preis für die Stiefel angemessen und vollkommen in Ordnung, so dass ich insgesamt nur die volle Punktzahl von 5 geben kann."
"Unsere Tochter liebt diese Gummistiefel, alleine wegen der Farbe und des Einhorn. Die Stiefel machen einen guten und soliden Eindruck und sie hat nicht so schlimme Schwitze-Füße darin. Für den Preis definitiv eine Kaufempfehlung."
"Comprati per mia figlia di 5 anni, per le escursioni nei fiumi e per quando piove. provati ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo. L'interno dello stivale rimane caldo e asciutto soprattutto. Buona anche la suola con tacchetti che evitano cadute per scivolamento.Buon acquisto!!!"
"Abbiamo scelto questo prodotto perché alla nostra bimba piacciono molto i cavalli e gli unicorni e indubbiamente ne è rimasta molto colpita e ha subito apprezzato gli stivali nuovi.....peccato che dopo il primo utilizzo ""di prova"" , nel giardino di casa in assenza di pozzanghere, l'immagine risulti già rovinata. Peccato davvero..Vestibilitá adatta."
"Stivaletti dai colori vivaci e comodi, la bambina li usa volentieri e ci cammina bene.Simpatica la fantasia utilizzata e l'unicorno e' un piccolo bonus che piace ai bambini.I materiali non mi entusiasmano, speriamo che durino nel tempo."
"Buy the real size your child currently wears, not bigger! According to the measurment scheme attached to the page you should order at least one size bigger. Wrong. This is what I did and it was a mistake. We kept the boots for the next season anyway (we like the boots overall)  and ordered one size smaller, t.i. the right size my girls wear now."
"Ich wollte diesesmal nicht auf den discounter zurückgreifen und testete diese Gummistiefel, leider bin ich sehr enttäuscht. Meine Tochter hat hinterher richtig nasse Socken, da sie hier drin sehr stark schwitzt. Das hatten wir bisher in keinen Schuhen bzw. Stiefeln."
Boots have an awful odorat! I take out from a plastic bag and they stayed all day out for aeration and nothing helped. That awful odorat of chemical plastic is everywhere at the house.. unfortunately they will go back..The boots are for a large foot
"Die Optik des Stiefels hat uns gefallen.Aber:Das Material ist nicht flexibel genug, es biegt sich nicht beim Gehen. Außerdem ist der Stiefel schwer für unsere 2-jährige Tochter."
"Ich habe mir die tollen Gummistiefel für meine Tochter bestellt. Sie trägt gerade Größe 23 und ich hatte ihr eine Nummer größer in 24 bestellt. Da hier einige meinten die Stiefel fallen kleiner aus, was ich aber garnicht zustimmen kann. Die Stiefel kann sie dann im Frühjahr anziehen bis dahin werden sie passen. Behalten haben wir sie weil sie wirklich super schön sind und auch von der Qualität her einwandfrei."
"Per ben due volte ho dovuto restituire l'articolo. Ordinato il n. 42, ma è arrivato il 41. Per la prima restituzione col cambio articolo ho parlato anche con un'operatrice amazon per essere sicuro mi venisse sostituito con la taglia giusta, ma nulla da fare,  la sostituzione è stata fatta sempre con taglia errata."
"Muy buena pinta, suela blandita, pero demasiado pequeño. Talo 41, compré 41 y es pequeño, lo devuelvo."
Desastre total. No tienen ni dos meses y apenas los he usado y ya están despegados o rotos por el talón.
Belle e comode mio figlio ne è soddisfatto
Ottime Sneakers calzano bene e la suola interna è molto comodo
Preciosos
"Ordinato 42.5. Ricevuto 41.Pero lo stile, colore e qualità sono top. Per questo due e non solo una stella."
bellissime scarpe davvero comoda e molto minimal stile element nice
Excelente producto
"Las zapatillas son muy bonitas, pero es la segunda vez que intento comprarlas y se equivocan con la talla."
"This shoe is sturdy, well made and very attractive (looks better in person than the photos). It fit me well as far as length and width, but unfortunately I had to return it because the left shoe was rubbing on my ankle bone. I guess my heel was fitting too low allowing the shoe to be high enough to ride on the bone instead of under it. An insert might have fixed the issue, but I don't like altering new shoes. I'm sure this issue is my anatomy and not the shoe design."
"Clarks are the best!  Love this shoe - it has support, is comfortable and the fit is exactly right!"
I got a size 11 and had to send them back. Couldn't even get my foot in them. Overall they're a cute shoe. But won't work for me!
Loved the styling. Sorry it was too short for my foot. Fit more like a 10.
Too small not the right shoe.
"Really wanted to love these shoes. Initially very comfortable. After three weeks of daily wear on vacation, body of shoe has stretched at least a full size with only walking. Discovered after a light drizzle that soles have ZERO grip."
No me han gustado a los dos meses de uso están rotas por la puntera y solo las uso para correr y hacer deporte máximo dos horas al día pésima calidad ni volverá a comprarlas.
Very good! I like to much
Manque un peu de largeur mais c est une des deux marque que je préfère pour travailler
I Love these ASICS. They are light & fit my feet perfectly.  Perfect for 12 hour shifts on the frontline. I really am impressed with this particular shoe.
"I got these to replace my Gel Excite 7s after the quiz on the Asics website told me these would be my best fit. I wanted something with more cushion than my last pair, but there's nothing soft about these soles at all. Its like running barefoot on pavement.. And the heel is so narrow, when I run, my heel goes over the sole and pinches between the sole and the shoe wall giving me blisters on the bottom of my heels. Ive tried a few runs and they don't get better. My knees and ankle hurt within the first mile due to lack of support. I can feel the shock in my heels with every strike. I wish I could return these. Please don't waste your money on these."
"These shoes are cute, have a nice fit, and are very comfortable. I also appreciate that they don’t make my size 10 feet look like I am wearing water skis. I have worn them for weight lifting and running and have had no issues with rubbing or sore feet."
I tried 4 different shoes and ended up returning them all except this pair. They've eased some of my joint pain in my knees & feet after long runs. Definitely recommend!
Love these shoes. Super bouncy and miraculously make my huge feet look small:)
Absolutely love this shoe! Will be ordering another pair. I’ve ran in mine and am now using them for everything. Super cute and light. Took wearing them for about a week to get them broken in and to the max comfort level.
Tienen muy buena calidad y  se ajustan muy bien
These look and feel fake. Glue everywhere! Another thing the insoles look as if it comes from a ten dollar made in china sneaker from a bargain store. There is no name on it anywhere. I remember reebok's having a name on the insole.Definitely feels and looks cheap! I bought these for home because I have Plantar Fasciitis and they even suck at home on hardwood floors. Outside they feel even worst. Oh and these things have 0 grip. Lol! The rubber slips as if it's plastic. 😏👎Waste of money!
"I am a 7-7.5 in shoes, & in Reebok, have always worn 7.5. I saw the reviews warning that these ran small, but the Mineral Mist, in 7.5, was $22, so...had to try. At first I thought they were just too small, but a lot of that is their thickness & stiffness. I decided I was keeping them anyway (did I mention $22), & within an hour of wearing them, they felt fantastic, & I think an 8 would have been loose. They are gorgeous, & the colors are as vibrant as pictured. My only complaint was that the left shoe was just a teeny bit narrower across the top, as you can see in my photo, but it isn't noticeable unless you're looking for it. And I'm not giving up my $22 pair, so I'll get over it. I can't even deduct a star for it.Love the retro style, & great colors. I would definitely recommend, & wouldn't hesitate to repurchase.(My pix are with & without flash to show the color difference, & the reflective strips.)"
Not just for hiking! I absolutely love these boots. I purchased them because I use to own quite a few pairs of Reebok shoes years ago and remembered how much I loved them and how comfortable they were and these are just as comfortable as I hoped they would be. I specifically was looking for Reebok when I found these. I wear an 8 and these in an 8 fit perfectly.  I loved that they came with black and purple shoelaces.
This product looks very nice but it is not a comfortable shoe. It desperately needs a comfortable insole as inside the shoe is very hard and it took a couple of days to break it in. I thought it would be comfortable if I continued to wear them but that was not the case. Too late to return them so I am stuck. I do not recommend this shoe.
Love the colors and the height of the shoe. The arch support is better than average. I went a half size up from my normal size and they were on the large side. After wearing them for an hour around the house the ball of my foot hurt terribly. Had to return them. Based on this experience I would steer clear of Reebock brand.
"I bought these because  needed a good pair of rugged shoes for mowing. These are perfect. I wish they had my 7 1/2  size, the they would fit perfectly. But they only had an 8, so I wear thicker socks so my feet don't slide in them too much. Very comfortable, only took one time of wearing them that they became more relaxed. Well worth the money."
"Love everything about these except they are very wide where they lace up. You pull the laces all the way right and they still is too much room. The shoelaces come undone so face even loosen with a double knot. That being said, I love these shoes the color and width of the sole. Very comfortable if they weren’t so big by top of the shoe."
"Love these, a lot of support and they look great. I am a true size 8 , ordered 8.5 because of all the reviews saying to size up 1/2 size and I’m glad I did, they fit and I can wiggle my toes at the top, I do think true size would have been too tight perhaps."
"Love the color, comfort and ankle support. Caught these guys in sale and could not resist. The review mentioned the sizes run small and I was worried because I'm naturally a large size so I ordered an entire full size up and they fit perfectly!"
Duraron como un mes o dos y luego se separó la suela del tenis sin ningún esfuerzo
Shoes came promptly and look great.
"these are great.  quite stylish and comfortable.  People always ask where i got these from, of course I don't tell them (smiling)"
Flash back to the 90’s!! I love the way they fit and feel on my feet!!!
I remember these back when I was in high school. I love the look and they're actually very comfortable. I wear them for style/nostalgia. Not for sports.
Great for the 80’s themed party I went to recently.
Love my BKs... they are true to size and comfortable!! Seller shipped immediately via fed ex. No issues!!
Very narrow in the toe. No cushion inside.
I love these shoes. They were the perfect throwback to the look I was going for and turned out to be really comfortable also. I’m always a getting people who stop and look and ask are those BKs and where did you find them. I’m thinking that I need all the colors.
So cute 😍 I love my new BK
"Great shoe, bad lace lock, stopped holding lace tight after a few weeks. Tried to get replacement lace or lock but unsuccessful. A bit disappointing for a pretty expensive toddler shoe."
Great fit and look
"Habe die Schuhe wieder zurückgeschickt,waren leider zu klein"
Están muy chulas aunqie un poco grandes. Yo utilizo siempre en adidas 38 y 2/3 y son un poco grandes de lo habitual.
"La talla es un poco más grande de lo normal, sin embargo se ajustan perfectamente."
Top
Bequem und leicht zu tragen. Perfekt für Laufen.Schöne Farbe passt zu allem.
Perfecto para caminar pasear ir al campo senderos
Très jolie basket et confortable je recommande
Perfecto
"This shoe is as expected:  1) affordable as I don't want to pay more than $40 for a good pair of shoes, 2) ugly as sin - just as depicted, and 3) comfortable.  Welcome to being 45yo."
"These were comfortable right out of the box and fit well. I purchased a10.5 and I have a narrow foot. I like the heel area because it really absorbs the shock. I purchased them to be able to walk on a wooded trail. I am able to comfortably walk over rocks, roots and dirt with complete support and shock absorbing cushioning. I have had these for 6 months and according to my pedometer I have put over a million steps on them and they are still as comfortable as when they were new.  I would recommend these for trail use or even as a good walking shoe for pavement because of the cushioning. I will purchase another pair when it's time to replace these."
Hab 2 Jahre hintereinander das gleiche Modell bestellt für meinen Sohn da er relativ breite und hohe Füße hat. Die Schuhe halten sehr gut warm und sind auch wasserdicht. Kann ich nur empfehlen.
"The media could not be loaded.
                




   prodotto e arrivato usato,in d'iscrizione era scritto nuovo.non e possibile ,non posso restituire"
Top!
Like these.  Fit is a little short & a little wide but that is what I usually have to put up with as I have narrow feet.
See above
Love them
Great for my 95 year old mother with a hammer toe!
"Just has it was expected, my min said that is perfect."
Great shoes
Lo devolví por demasiado grande y aún no han reembolsado el dinero.
"Los zapatos son originales de hombre, ojo, son de orma grande, corren media talla o quizá 1 entera más de lo normal, los pedí talla 7 y me quedaron bien, igualmente calzo 7.5"
they look great.
Great product
verdaderamente confortables y suaves para caminar
The Stitching Came Apart after 1 Time Wearing it
These shoes were much too large.
Amazing
"Loved the shoes! I'm not a dancer but I'm wearing them as flats. The seller was super diligent in connecting with me to make sure I understand how to measure. I just based it on the measurement when I put a tape measure to my foot.Since I'm wearing this as an ""everyday shoe"" I've put in some insoles which have made them a bit tighter but the leather will eventually adjust. Happy with my purchase!"
"Pros: Made nicely, seem like comfortable, if it is your fit.Cons: Run large. My foot is 7 medium width, After reading the reviews I went from 7 (thats my Nikes, Sketchers-relaxed fit sneakers size), to 6.5 and they are still too big. Should have ordered at least 6. And still the fit is interesting. It is good that they have free return option with amazon prime, cause it is not so easy to find your fit. I am returning them and dont think I will order another size, cause they dont feel right for Zumba (slippery, no ankle support). But they might be good for other dancing lessons, like ballet for non-profs. If your foot is narrow, not high arch I would even recommend going from 7 to 6, cause in time they have a tendency to strech. (I can easily insert a finger, photo included)."
Bought these for my 16 year old son for a musical he is in.  He normally wears an 11 1/2 in tennis shoe and the size 12 fit perfectly.
"I needed to order jazz shoes for my daughter when she auditioned and earned a role for our local community theater. It was a first time for us, so I had no idea which of the shoes online to order. Ultimately I decided on these based on the good reviews and I’m glad I did! They were perfect. Fit as expected and good quality.theyve stood up to the last three months of rehearsals and still look great. For reference my daughter is a size 5-6 depending on the shoe."
"The shoe looks like it is three times too small....until you put it on and realize that it stretches at the arch area to allow you to have a hell under your heel and a pad under the ball of your foot.  Despite the heel and pad, you will feel as it you are barefoot, but that is part of the design, so buy it if that is what you are looking for.  If you want/need something rigid that will offer support all around your foot, this is NOT the shoe for you.  It is, essentially, a leather sock, with something solid underneath to withstand the wear of dancing on.  If you plan on dancing a lot and want them to last, then have a cobbler add leather or suede sole to the bottom surface (floor contact) so that they last.  For the price, just order another pair when these wear out.  The fit is comfortable, however, you will want to insert some kind of liner in the front toe section of the shoe, at the very least, if not for odor management, then for comfort. The primary reason for this is the fact the very front of the shoe, where the pads of your toes rest, has NO insole, only rippled leather (extremely uncomfortable.  The insole of the shoe falls short about 2 cm or maybe 1"" of the very tip of the front of the shoe, so the pads of your toes will press on the stictching and ribbed material where the leather shoe is sewn to the sole pad.  Look at the pictures in the description.  Where you see leather ripples/ridges in the toe area....there is no liner, sole, or pad covering this area inside the shoe.  Your toes will not be happy.  An easy, cheap solution is to purchase, trim, and insert thin shoe liners that reach all the way up to the front of the shoe, and then you will be very happy with these shoes.  They are great for practicing or even dancing (socially), but be careful that others do not step on your feet because you will have no protection for the top of your toes.  Happy dancing!!"
"The shoes seem fine, but going by sizing guide they are too large.  Especially considering you need to have them start out fitting very tight because they will stretch.  I don't know any dancers who like their shoes to fit loose & sloppy.  You want them to fit like a second skin to your feet.  While your toes need to be able to spread, you don't want your  feet sliding or slipping inside of the shoe.Will need to return and order a smaller size.  I ordered 7 1/2 and I wear a size 8 to 8 1/2 size street shoe, but it is hard to compare that to dance shoes.  Dance shoes need to fit different than street shoes.  Also, the lining inside one of the shoes was all bent up & would have been uncomfortable to wear.  I hope the next pair will not have the lining rolling up."
"Even in Chair Yoga we get out of the chair and do some standing poses.  I wear a size 8.5 shoe but I need orthodics  in them. So sometimes I have to go up a half size or even a full size.  I ordered these and they fit perfect with my orthotics in them!  They are super soft leather so it's like I am barefoot with the support I need.  I can do all of the seated and standing poses, not perfectly, but that would take a miracle."
"My son dances a lot for musical theatre. I just looked up this order and am amazed at how long they lasted, well over a year, but  the sole is getting worn down now. They still look pretty good and support him but he is 15 and still growing so I think I probably ordered them on the large side but they are super comfy for him while dancing and if he forgets to take them to class he gets sore if he uses regular shoes.But I need to get the tan color instead of black so I re-measured his feet and will be ordering up by one size and definitely sticking with this brand.For the price I think these performed really well--all the seams are still perfect, nothing ripped or torn, just use shows wear on the soles and on the  leather part of the toe, partly from his feet growing.  For an adult or kid who dances more than him they will probably last for 6- 12 months. When new, they look just like the picture shows and don't need to be broken in."
I followed directions and purchased the shoe a size or two up . I wear a 10 1/2 or 11 when it's cut  small  i know to get a 12 or 13 because i have wide feet . But great quality . I have used the shoe many times.  I will buy it again.
"After reading many reviews, I decided to just do what the manufacturer suggested. I measured my daughter's foot, which heel to toe was exactly 9 3/4 inches. Based on the manufacturer's own guide, I ordered an 8.5 for her. In my gut I knew this had to be wrong, as she usually wears 7.5 or 8 max. But based on their own guidelines, I went for it. THEY. WERE. HUGE. HUGE. and HIDEOUS. I wear a 9 and they were HUGE on ME. She needed them asap, so I hop on and order a size 7.5, thinking an entire size down would be better. Wrong again. The 7.5 were better, but still and entire size too big for her. .At this point I gave up, took her to our local dance store and ponied up the $15 extra they cost there vs. these. They fit great and are much more attractive. I would not recommend these. Not worth my time, and now I have to send these monsters back lol."
"Passt perfekt!In Frankreich ist es unmöglich, Fußballschuhe dieser Größe zu finden!Schade, dass ich sie momentan nicht auf dem Feld ausprobieren kann!"
"Super Prodokut, wie beschrieben."
Purtroppo è arrivato un 44 anziché un 45 fatto reso
Bester Schuhe. Schnee Lieferung mega Preis
Passt gut und schnelle Lieferung
"Gute Beschreibung, schnelle Lieferung und passt perfekt 😄"
"They are super comfortable like all of the Cloudstepper line. I love that these are slip on, but like all slip on shoes they don't provide a lot of side support. That being said, I have worn nothing else since buying them. Who really wants to tie up shoelaces? These are men of a certain age shoes and done well."
Didn't like the fit and look. Had to return.
I have problem feet and order for house shoes.  The shoes arrived and tried them on perfect.  No break in period shoes were perfect.  Will order again.  Thanks for a great product.
It looks good. Fitted as expect.
"Just as advertised,  fast delivery"
"The cleats break, and this is the second that it has done it in."
"An sich, ein hervorragender Schuh (Material, Verarbeitung , Futter) Nur war er zu schwer, zu schmal (Schaft sowie vorne an den Zehen) und das Futter war so dick, dass er sich kaum hat schließen lassen. Bei dem stolzen Preis, hätte ich etwas mehr erwartet"
"Wunderschöner kleiner Stiefel, leider war die Sohle zu unbeweglich. Mein Sohn konnte nicht mit laufen,daher ging der Schuh zurück!"
"Sehr schön, das auch die Einlegesohlen mit demselben Fell ausgelegt sind. Sehr empfehlenswert"
Der Schuh kam leider defekt an... Die Sohle löst sich an der Seite vom Schuh.
"Great shoe for DH who’s recovering from knee replacement surgery.  Comfortable with a good solid footbed, easy on and off.  As suggested, I ordered a half size down from his usual and they’re a perfect fit.  Fast delivery too….. thanks again Amazon Prime!"
"Very comfortable and light weight. I ordered exact size extra wide. Perfect fit. These shoes are hard to find, thank you amazon!"
New Balance very well made and the right fit 🙂
Great shoes and service

"Comfortable and stylish for my son with autism.  He has wide feet and plantar fasciitis which causes heel pain in addition to having discomfort from flat feet. These are true to size, well crafted and highly recommended!"
"I really love my old (now discontinued) 801 slip-on/clogs but needed a replacement.  Whatever your regular NB sneaker size is should be appropriate for these (I'm usually a 10.5 in NB and tried a 10.5 and 11 in these - the 10.5 was the best one).  That said, they do fit differently than the 801s - your heel lifts out of the back more, and the sneakers seem a little narrower (even though both are ""D"" width).  It's just a different design, you get used to it enough.  The new ones are more up to date so are better from a looks perspective."
"These slips are really comfortable,  however I wish I would have bought them a half size smaller.  They fit perfect when I first bought them, but after having them for about a month, they have losened up. As people have said, you can't run in them, well no kidding, they are slides, they will slide off your feet if you try to run in them. As far as the low back, ummm, slides, hello, they are supposed to have a low back, if you want something with a higher back, by Shoes, not SLIDES. I would have give 5stars, but the sizing issuse cot them a point."
"After several months of pretty consistent use.. Love them.. no issue whatsoever. They have worn as expected, I'm not working in them but I wear them for leisure consistently from the beach to the campground to around the house, etc.. Picture is wear at about 4 months.."
Back of heel cup is soft and does not rebound after being stepped onto as the older NB slip-on did. It was solid. I’m hoping they bring back the old model which was built like my NB running shoe. Outstanding!
"Der Schuh ist kein Billigprodukt und auch nicht preiswert. Aber genau der sollte es für den Sohn sein. Da er Einlagen tragen muss, haben wir ihn eine Nummer größer bestellt und die vorhandenen Einlagen gegen die orthopädischen ausgetauscht. Da der Junior immer am Rennen ist muss der Schuh schon etwas mitmachen - und nicht nur gut aussehen. Junior trägt ihn nun zwei Monate und wir (insbesondere er) sind überaus zufrieden. Keine nassen oder kalten Füße (okay hier ist auch noch kein Winter). Also eine Empfehlung."
"Toller Schuh, gute Passform, leicht und gute Qualität! Reduziert stimmt auch der Preis!Klare Kaufempfehlung!"
"Calzan bien, son cómodos, pero no son para entrenamiento. Son pesados, son para salir al día a día."
"El color es muy lindo, la talla ajusta perfecto, son muy ligeros y súper cómodos. Recomiendo su compra ampliamente."
"me encantaron , tuve problemas con la paqueteria pero si llegaron :)"
These shoes are beautiful and I do mean beautiful.  They are also well made and the leather is supreme.  However they  wear horribly. They wear very hot and the shoes are extremely heavy.  Within a week of wearing them I also developed plantar fasciitis.
"I love these shoes so far. I got the pale pink which is basically a neutral with my skin tone. I’m between an 8 and 8.5 usually, and size 8 fit perfectly. Lots of support in these shoes too and soo comfortable! My only worry is that the suede will show dirt quickly, so I treated these with a suede protector and so far they are good."
"The shoes are so comfy and I get a lot of compliments on these. However these have zero suede! The shoes are more of a final with a cushioned and comfortable lining. Even the box says suede, but there is no suede or leather on these ahoes"
"Shoe is attractive, seems true to size, feels a bit heavy, but I like a heavy shoe.  I haven't worn shoe yet, but looks like there is no arch support, if so I'll use an insert. Good bargain for the price. Not sure if real Reebok as logo missingfrom shoe but word Reebok is Imprinted on sole of shoe and it comes in Reebok box."
Cute and comfy. They are a mix of leather and nylon. Only thing is they are a little roomy for a 7.5. but I got them for a friend with wider feet so they will be good for her. I would buy a 7 for myself.
"Good. Fits well, I use this shoe when lifting weights at the gym or dancing because of its flatness. Nice colors, heard from others it’s good quality. Will update if any issues appear."
This Reebok is fire!!!!!!! Excellent! This is a work of art!! I love it! It fits great. I am a size 8 and i bought a size 8 and its just perfect. I am severly excited about this pair of sneakers and would recommend it to anyone.
"Viene reducido,"
Perdí talla 25.5 cm. y me mandaron 23.5 cm. Lastima porque si están bonitos :/
"Very nice tennis shoes. My son loves them! The color is what sold them, and it’s just ass vibrant in person. Looks good on the foot."
These shoes are awesome so far. I have Morton's neuroma in my foot so I'm always looking for a shoe with a wider toe box and cushion. I have played with these twice on hard court and I have had no toe jam and there is plenty of cushion. I tried the B width as well but those were a little too snug. The wide which felt really roomy but in the end worked great on court. There is no break in period. I am a 5.0 player and i'm rough on my shoes so we will see how well these hold up.
"I was so excited to received these because they looked so cool and flashy but immediately after I tried them on, they were super uncomfortable. The crease just above the top of the laces cut into my toes when I would bend my feet to take a step. I was surprised because the reviews claimed to be comfortable and did not need any breaking in. I must have got a bad pair. I returned them for a different brand entirely."
I bought these to replace my last pair of court shoes for pickleball.  This time around I'm spending more because these are to be good for my planter fasciitis.  They feel comfortable just walking around the house!  Can't wait to use them on the courts in the morning!  They may be worth the extra $$.(I can live with just about any color if they fit right :) )
I play tennis and this shoe is easy on my bunion and the knit material gives. I can play without any bunion pain. it is a wider shoe I ordered a 9B and it was perfect.
"I first tried a pair of 8.5 wide in the Guava/black through the prime wardrobe.  They were too big.  I normally wear 8 wide but my arches have started to drop,  getting flat footed so I’ve been trying a half size larger.  I sent them back and tried the black/lime in 8 wide.  I couldn’t get my foot into the shoe!  They were very tight.  I sent them back and ordered the guava/black in 8.5 wide again.  I loved the color.  Just a little out there for an old lady but I like them.  The second pair fits great!  There are differences in where the shoes are made and who made  them and what day it is.  It’s a crap shoot.  I do recommend this shoe.  They are so comfortable on old feet.  I love the guava color.  I’ve gotten complements on them."
"This would be a great shoe, unless you have high arches. There is NO arch support and they are sooo flat. They are light, and breathable and great in every other way. But even with arch supports i had to send these back. Definitely more cushion in heel and leaves arches and front foot feeling beat up."
"The back material and the front material inside the shoe isn't sewn together. It looks like to me it should be. A plastic like material is showing. BN won't answer phone. Sent text and pics their website site said to do , no response. I guess I need to send back. Can't find out if it is a defect. Poor workmanship even if it is suppose to be like this. I got the extra wide 10.5 and it still feels a little tight. The shoe strings are too short. I had another pair of NB shoes in pass that the string whee too short. I have to take the strings out of some of the whole to be able to have them loose enough to tie. That pair was from 5-10 years ago. Thought they would know by now to make their strings longer. I have a high arch, I don't know if that is the reason I need more string length, but this is the only manufacturer that I have run into this problem. If I but a pair of the mens I don't have that problem, just some of their women tennis shoes. I can't keep waiting for them to respond to tell me if this is a defect to send them back.  Does anyone else that bought this show have the material inside the shoe look like this? where the front material and the back material in the inside isn't sewn together? Please someone let me know, since I can't get a response from NB."
but the fit is perfect.  Will definitely order this again.  I was wearing Asics and the toe box on the Asics were so tight that I had horrible blisters.  Switched to New Balance and won't go back.  The color is BRIGHT pink - but I am gettin used to it.
"I sometimes take a 6 medium width, sometimes a 6 wide, depending on the shoe.  I've had New Balance before and no issues.  However this court shoe in a size 6 was ridiculously narrow, I couldn't even get my foot into the shoe with the laces wide open.  Sending back."
Love the comfort of these shoes. Nice to actually feel comfortable in a pair of court shoes.
Besser als erwartet. Top unf schnelle Lieferung.
Ordered a size down from what I usually wear and they fit perfectly!
The shoe does not look quite like the picture. It is over sized and I believe that Daffy Duck was the foot model. Unfortunately past the window to returnThese look like a KNOCKOFF
I love them! I read the reviews in advance and made sure to buy a size and a half smaller than I would usually wear. They fit perfectly. They look fashionable and feel comfortable.
Beautiful shoe but runs a bit large. I had to return unfortunately
"I love the style, the color the shape of this shoe, but I unfortunately didn't read about the sizing on these until after I already ordered them, and by then it was too late!  But all the reviews are true - these shoes run really big.  I'm thinking a size 5 might do it for me (normally I wear a 6, but in Adidas 5.5 seems to fit better, over all).  I ordered these in a 5.5 and they are considerably large.  As I said, thinking a size 5 might do it, but not sure.  Anyone considering these shoes, please take heed - you will most likely need at least a half size below what you usually wear in Adidas."
"I like the shoes - I’m just lucky I saw ahead of time that they run so big.  The size 8 I just bought is the same, maybe a little bigger, than different pairs of size 9 adidas I have.  I understand different brands can fit differently (my doc martens are size 8), but I think it’s weird to have so much variation in similar shoes of the same brand."
"This shoe runs big. I went out of the country and missed my return date. Now I'm stuck with an oversized brand new pair of shoes and most likely not going to get what I spent on it. The shoe itself arrived ok. It seemed like it can get damaged or bent super easily. Either way, not happy with the sizing difference. Not even a little big, it's just too much."
This is so fake it’s ridiculous. Do not buy!! The tongue is a thin foam sheet with the adidas logo printed on it. Not stitched. It’s horrible and ugly and the sides have weird stitching. Just a horrible product. I’m surprised this came from amazon. Disappointed ☹️
They were embarrassingly squeaky. They felt like they were made of cardboard—especially the tongue of the shoe. I returned them.
"As others saidBefore it does run big. I am normally size 8.5/9, and this shoesStill a tiny big for me, but I am okay with it!But the shoes look just like in the picture  and are very comfortable. I really like it."
"Son preciosas, súper cómodas, me encantan, las recomiendo si o si"
"Wirklich schöne, bequeme Schuhe. Ich hatte etwas Sorge, da meine Füße relativ breit sind, aber die Schuhe passen hervorragend. Ich habe Größe 39/40 und habe Größe 40 bestellt, so habe ich wirklich viel Platz im Schuh ohne das er zu groß ist und ich mit der Verse rauskriegen oder ähnliches."
Me quedan perfectos los compre de oferta a un precio que no me esperaba tal como el anuncio y originales
"La talla muy bien,tal cual se ven"
Die Schuhe passen wie angegossen und sind super bequem. 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 5 Sterne daher.

"Belle basket, ras, je recommande"
"Basket acheté le 10 septembre 2021,de mauvaise qualité,je me suis dis que c'était Lévis alors que ça serait quand même solide non la preuve a peine un mois après déjà décollé et un trou dans la chaussure,cet article est fait en chine ce n'est pas étonnant,je ne recommande pas,le prix était pas très cher,mais ce n'est pas une raison,déçu de cette achat."
"Bought similar pair before but the size was US 6 last time, this time round both size is US 6B seem a little tighter for comfort. Seller should have mentioned."
Bottom tread is gone in 2 months. Won’t buy Spenco again

Articolo corrispondente alle mie esigenze. È ciò che cercavo
tutto perfetto come in descrizione
Mi piace non fa male
"Die Schuhe passen super, haben ein tolles Design und sind angenehm zu tragen. Man hat auch ein recht gutes Gefühl mit dem Ball. Ich habe mir die Schuhe bestellt, weil ich meinen alten immer Fußschmerzen hatte... die Beschwerden sind nun weg."
"While I did like the fit and the upper padding, I had to return because the flat sole had me slipping around in the turf indoor while I’m in goal. I then got the same shoe with the turf soles and love them. Someone else I know who Only plays on field Prefers the flat soles so they don’t get caught in the turf. So I’m happy they offer the shoe with both soles."
They were not comfortable. They buckled up when I flexed by foot and was painful. These are wide so maybe that is why.It did have a nice solid sole that I think would have kept me front getting bruises on the bottom of my feet but the part where it buckled up on the top was too much.
"These are nice shoes, but I ordered them specifically because I am wide. I would recommend sizing up 1/2 size when ordering. I wish I would have ordered the 8.5."
Muy buenos zapatos y la talla muy apropiada.
Very comfy shoes but slide a lot on an interior gymnasium surface.
"Bien,  pero una cosa ,pedi a la vezi otras sandalias tambien 28 y cuando le estoy mediendo los dos, estos son más un 27."
Era para un regalo y se ven de calidad.
Impresionante lo bonitas que son!!!

Me encantaron
"El producto llegó en una talla que no era la solicitada eran para bebe, en la descripción del producto decía que eran de 22 cm y llegaron de 10 cm"
"Supercute and very comfortable shoes. Fit as expected. Love the snake print and the shoelace color. I usually wear size 7, bought size 7 and they fit perfectly. Shipping was also fast."
L'oggetto acquistato è giunto prima del tempo di spedizione previsto e sopratutto è in perfette condizioni. Descrizione dell'oggetto e delle taglie molto dettagliata. Straconsigliato!!!
Fit great and look great. I love the unusual color and texture of snakeskin
No ajusta bien
"I really like this shoe. Great fit, great look."
Der Schuh passt genau wie erwartet. Vor allem die halben Größen sind von Vorteil und der Schuh ist sehr bequem.
Super cute and fun. Got tons of compliments on them. I’m a size 7.5 and these shoes were true to size. They are a medium in width- meaning they are not too narrow for my foot that likes a little wiggle room.
Schöner Schuh passt wie erwartet und sieht gut aus auch die Farbe ist Ok bin zufrieden sind halt Converse Schuhe
"Fit perfectly, have gotten lots of compliments on them"
"Extremely expensive, especially due to it being sent from US."
Cute pair of sneakers!!
以前といっても微かな記憶の話ですが店舗で履いた時に24センチを履いている私が幅広の為に25センチ位が丁度いいと…で、今回24センチ履きを25センチというのはと悩み24.5センチを購入。結果、やっぱり25センチだったようです。小指が当たります、ちょっとしんどい。コンバースは、店舗で試すに限ります。デザインは可愛いですね。ちょっと紐の結び方をアレンジしたり。気持ちがあがります！
"Got them for my daughter, she loves them"
そもそも、この靴を買いたかったのは、実を言わせてもらうと、私は、演歌歌手の、水森かおり、ファンクラブの一人です！そのかおりさんがあるブログの写真でこの靴を履いていたので、真似したくて買ったのです！近くの靴屋さんに行ってもなくてアマゾンさんを調べたらあったのです買いました、大変満足しています。
私通常２４．５ｃｍを履いています。ジャックパーセルも２４．５ｃｍでジャストサイズです。オールスターを試し履きしたところ、２４．５ｃｍは小さく２５．０ｃｍは少し大きいかなという感じでした。底が薄いというレビューが多い事もあるので中敷きを入れるようにし２５．０ｃｍを購入しました。ジャックパーセルと同様のカップインソールをいれた処レース幅も広くならず見た目もスッキリ、ジャストサイズになりました。因みにオールスター１００は最初からカップインソール仕様になっています。
夏場は白(*^ｰ^)冬になったので、濃いめの色が欲しかったので…届くのを楽しみにしてました。発送も早く、思った通り可愛くて☆黒にして良かったです！
"Although these are cute and very lightweight, as other posters have said they run small. In my case I ordered a size up, and they were still too small.  They also have a very narrow toebox, which affects the fit as well. The insole is definitely squishy, however there is next to zero arch support. This of course can be good for some people, as can the narrow toebox ( these would be great for one of my daughters, however they are not available in her size).  They do seem to be constructed well, and feel sturdy, although the sole is so light that it seems it would not hold up well over a few trail walks, but I have to return these so I won't be able to find out for sure about that."
"My biggest problem with these shoes was that they rubbed the back of my Achilles tendon area. Maybe that only happens with some people, I really don't know the reason. That was pretty much all it took for me to stop wearing them. They have a comfortable sole which is like memory foam or something. The shoe is a bit narrow so if your feet swell from activity they may be a bit too tight at the end of your day. I wore them hiking but they're really more of a straight out walking and maybe running shoe. I bought them in gray which was also a bit boring and made my foot look longer."
"I love these shoes!!  However, they do seem run a little small; which is why I gave them 4 stars.  I usually wear a 7.5, which is what I ordered.  But I could tell when I first put them on that they were a little tight right up against my big toe. The first day was the worst one. They were already feeling tight but I jumped down to the ground from a platform to run to the car and as soon as I landed, my big toenails (and yes, they were cut) hit the toe of the shoe and I could feel that little bit of pain for the rest of the day.  It's day three and I can tell they've stretched a little bit, but next time I'll try an 8 to be on the safe side.  Otherwise, they are extremely comfortable.  They're very soft and very light--I hate wearing heavy, clunky shoes.  They're the perfect shape, also.  Not too small and thin like a simple pair of old school Keds, but not too bulky that you feel like they'd only work with jeans or athletic wear. I had on a nice grey t-shirt and some knee-length, jean shorts and they didn't make my feel look like giant boats.  I would definitely order more in different colors."
"I usually where heavy walking shoes with lots of padding, plus custom orthopedic inserts, so I was concerned that I would not be able to wear these very long.  However the foot bed is very comfortable, and I find that I forget I am wearing them.  Although I checked the ""all day"" rather than ""couple of hours"" box, I probably would not wear them all day--but definitely more than just a couple of hours. My only complaint is that they only come in one width and for me are a little bit too narrow."
"I've begun walking at least 10,000 steps/day and was developing severe blisters on the balls of my feet, spreading to between my toes. I thought I had a good pair of shoes, but apparently not. As soon as I put these shoes on for my first walk on the treadmill after receiving them, it was as if the blisters were never there! These shoes are extremely lightweight and so comfortable!! I've been able to increase my walking and not have pain in my feet at all! I would highly recommend these shoes to anyone!!!!!"
"You kind of feel the grid below the padding at the palm of the foot.Sizing is right. Looks like a good shoe. But I'm worried if the padding gets more compressed as one walks, you feel the underneath grid even more.  :|"
"As soon as I put these babies on they felt like clouds. They offered me tremendous support on my feet. The color was a good color and the inside of the shoe is so soft, I wished all shoes were like these, soft and warm but pretty on the eyes"
"These shoes are super lite, have this great memory foam insole and have held up very well. I used them for work in Healthcare. Lots of walking. But this would serve as a great running shoe as well."
"I love the color, the design and the fact that they are very light weight. Like some other reviews stated, they do seem to run small, especially in the toes. I had even ordered them a half size larger than I usually wear."
"I like these shoes.  I mainly walk for exercise and find them comfortable.  The size 7 fits well in width, but is a bit small for a walking shoe.  The size 8 is a bit wide.  Amy feet are narrow so it is not unusual to have width issues."
"Der Schuh hat eine schöne, weiche Sohle, wenn man Probleme mit den Fersen hat, ist er einfach super. Sehr angenehm zu tragen."
"Los devolví cuando llegaron vi que son brillosos, estaba esperando algo negro liso"
"Son amplios, no los recomiendo para pie angosto, son bonitos."
Too stiff to wear for an extended period of time and feel a bit clunky.  I wish I would have sent them back instead of trying to wear them.  Now I'm stuck with them.
Purchased size 10 as other reviews said they ran large. Big mistake. Should have stuck with11 as they are somewhat narrow
"These shoes are a little stiff especially over tops of the feet, but I'm hoping they will get more comfortable over time with wear."
Good item.
It runs small and ripped up my heel as the back is hard
Comfy and good quality.
"At first glance, I thought something was off with these black suede 1100s but I was not quite sure what was amiss. So I got out my favorite blue suede 1100s for comparison (see pictures).1. The contours of the shoe were different from my blue pair of the 1100s2.and upon closer inspection, the insoles were also quite different.You can see in the pictures my trusty blue suede 1100s come with a more expensive removable insole. The difference in quality is clear. but only because I have an authentic pair from a reputable brick and mortar store to compare the convincing knockoff 1100s to are the differences made apparent.Don't get me wrong I don't mind low cost ""replicas"", but I paid almost 140 with taxes for these. This could just be a one-off, or perhaps knockoffs are going undetected more than I imagined. Maybe the negative reviews for these shoes are actually for knockoffs and not the authentic NB product?In any event, I highly recommend you visit your local brick and mortar retailer. Call ahead and ask if they have the 1100s in your size and request they order them in all the colors you are interested in trying. That's how I ended up with the blue ones.  Any local retailer still in business has to be doing something right and will be happy to order whatever you want."
"I wish I hadn’t worn them or I’d send them back.  I ordered them as I kind of like the way they looked and I generally like NB. Narrower than a normal D. Uncomfortable on the TOP, as the laces dig in some. For me, OK to wear if I’m only going to be in them a little while and not walking much. Definitely not a walking shoe.So I've had these a couple of months now and thought I would share what I've found.The good - they are cool looking. i get comments every time I wear them and folks are surprised to see they are NB.They've gotten a bit more comfy as they have worn in some, but these are not shoes for being on your feet all day and they are definitely not a walking shoe. Good for casual wear.The bad - the sole (black rubber beneath the maroon sole) separated at the front on both shoes rather soon. I used some shoe glue (Amazon) and it did the trick, but one would think they could have joined them better at manufacturing.Would I buy them again? maybe. They do look good."
Do not fit like other NB shoes.  They were very long.  They felt like clown shoes.  Sent hem back... they even tried to charge me shipping.  Complained and they relented.
"I never wore these shoes. My recent shoes from New Balance have all been size 13 4E (extra wide). I have several pairs of NB shoes in that size that fit me well. These shoes were much too big. I liked the way these shoes looked, but didn't think it would be worth the trouble to try multiple sizes to see if I could find a pair that would fit."
"I now have two pairs of these shoes, and there is no doubt in my mind I will buy more!  I will probably own every color (6) by the time I’m done, that’s how great these shoes are!  They are very comfortable, as long as a proper insole is added (I have to do this with all my work shoes, as I walk 7 to 10 miles each day).  I also recommend, as others have, getting the wide size. Other than that, they are super stylish, comfy, and well made."
"I'm a 10.5 EEEE and I buy these in 11 and they fit great, look a little big but not crazy big.I wish new balance wouldn't cancel this line (looks like they have) and I wish they would make a cool boot in the same platform /sole!!!"
"I love the New balance 1100 shoes, I have them in blue, black, and brown (my favorite).  They're very comfortable and appropriate for my office or going out.  They're great with jeans or cords or khakis, wouldn't wear them with dressier pants."
"I wanted to love these, since I'm a big New Balance fan, and I like the idea of a quasi casual shoe for work, but these weren't as comfortable as I was hoping and I couldn't justify keeping them at $130 a set... If they were under $100 and/or had more of a sneaker feel I would have kept them probably"
"I've been looking for a classy yet very comfortable everyday shoe for awhile, so I was glad when I found these! They run true to size, and are narrow. If you have wide feet they might not work for you. I've been wearing these for the last few weeks and they've held up well. I plan to pick-up a few additional ones to have. Do feet a favor and buy these!"
"Usually for my 11,8"" foot I order sneakers in size 12,5 D but due to previous reviews I purchased this shoes in 12 4E & now I'm happy with this extraordinary pair of NB"
Perfette e comodissime
Scarpe comodissime e arrivate molto prima del previsto. Consiglio!
Sneakers molto belli
"I bought these sneakers for my 83 year old mom. We're both preppys from the old days; her the 50-60's and me from the 80's. Unfortunately, the shoes were just too narrow for her foot, and weren't comfortable.  Thus, they were returned. I, on the other hand, do not have a pair of red sneaks, and Sperry fit my foot just fine. I will purchase for myself with a five start review!"
Cute but much narrower then my other pairs.
"A este artículo le doy 10/10, me encantaron. Son los clásicos sperry"
"Brand new, a little tight first time wearing them, but after about 3 wears, fit just fine."
"These shoes are super cute and comfortable! I love them, would buy again!"
I really like these shoes!! Very classic look and extremely comfortable!! Great for my spring and summer look!!
Didn’t like fit or style.
I don’t think it’s a good quality.
Love the color and brand the sticking along the heel hurts
The shoes are nice a bit snug though.  But just break them in and you are good to go.
Buono
Non confortevoli perché risultano essere più piccole della taglia indicata
scarpe di bassa qualita
Chaussures très confortables grâce à la soft foam. Mon seul souci est que la chaussure est un peu étroite pour mes pieds. Sinon ça serait parfait

"Der Winter kommt, das weiß ich sicher. Wie ich ihn dieses Jahr verbringen werde, ist eine Frage für sich.Doch, man braucht Schuhe, die man in der Zeit, in der sich Sonne nur zögernd zeigt, schon mal der ganze Tag regnerisch ist, der Schnee ist auch nicht weit.Wenn die Tage im Nebel versinken, tut es gut, wenn die Schuhe (es sind hörere Schue, keine Sneaker(s) im üblichen Sinne) in einer schönen Farbe signalisieren - da bin ich, man sieht mich. ROT ist die Farbe der Schuhe, und sie ist einfach wunderschön.Die Schuhe sind in ""H"" Größe/Weite, also weiter geschnitten, was mir/uns ermöglicht sie mit den Wollsocken zu tragen. Neben schwarzen Schnürsenklen, die fast dramatisch wirken, gibt es auf jeder Seite einen Reißverschluss, der sich sehr leich öffnen lässt.Man kommt in die Schuhe sehr leicht hinein. Die Füße danken es ihnen. Die Schuhe drücken nirgendwo, sie sind leicht und doch stabil.Meine übliche Größe passt hier.Es sind KEINE Goretex-Schuhe, man soll daran denken, wenn man im Regen/Schnee spazieren geht. Aber, sie vertragen schon etwas Nässe...Kälte, wie geschrieben, mit Socken.Sie sehen an den Beinen ansprechend aus. Perfekt kombinierbar, wirklich tragbar und wieder in SALE. Auch der reguläre Preis ist nichz zu hoch.So sehr ich Sneaker liebe, kann nur schwierig ""nein"" sagen, wenn ich wieder ein neues Modell sehe, so bin ich bei Herbst/Winterschuhen einer oder höchstens zwei Marken treu geblieben. Diese ist eine von beiden.Was mir gefällt, die Form ist modern, auch hier hat die Firma einige Schritte gemacht.Von mir eine klare Kaufempfehlung!"
"Sehr schöne ""ARA Damen Courtyard Sneaker"" im Farbton grau! Mir gefällt insbesondere die dunkle Sohle mit schmalem Silberstreifen, ist nicht so schmutzempfindlich. Die Sneaker sehen schick aus, sind super bequem, warm gefüttert mit innen liegender HighSoft Sohle. Ich schnüre die Sneaker so, dass ich nur eine Seite der je beiden Reißverschlüsse öffnen brauche, um die Schuhe an- , bzw. auszuziehen. Wie immer passt die bestellte Größe 38. Schon allein deshalb kaufe ich gerne ARA Schuhe!"
"Ja die Schuhe sind schon etwas teurer, aber dafür lohnt es sich. Die sind unglaublich bequem und geradezu gemütlich. Hab sie mir gleich noch in einer anderen Farbe bestellt. Klare Kaufempfehlung."

"Certainement de bonnes chaussures ARA mais les chaussures livrées ne correspondent pas à la photo. Sur la photo de présentation, les semelles sont marrons et j'ai été livré de chaussures avec des semelles blanches : cela ne donne pas du tout le même style. J'ai donc retourné les chaussures et j'ai été remboursé sans aucun problème et très rapidement."
"Ich finde die Schuhe super, allerdings waren sie mir in meiner regulären Schuhgröße 42 zu klein."
Ein sehr gut verarbeiteter Sneaker! Super Qualität super mit herausnehmbaren Sohlen!! Ist sehr bequem und optisch auch perfekt!!! Sehr zu empfehlen!
"Hatte den Sneaker zur Auswahl mit Mehreren bestellt. Es war eindeutig der Beste.Super schönes Tragegefühl,  tolle Innensohle, bequem, warm...einfach ein toller Winter Sneaker!"

Light and airy... Not supportive at all. If you are on your feet for long hours buy arch support insoles before trying to wear these... And wear socks that come higher than the cuff or you will be rubbed raw. I recommend getting a half size bigger than you usually wear.
These were a gift for a friend who admired them while I was shopping. The first pair were too big but returned them and Alex is thrilled with them. They look really cool. I don’t think they will be ever out of style. She’s talking about buying another pair. The price is very reasonable for the great quality.  You should try a pair.
I got these usually have no problem with puma shoes but these are a  little on a small side ordered a 9 but feels like a 8.5. I have blister under my ankle bone on both feet  the tops of my toes hurt from wearing these.
J'ai commandé un point et j'ai reçu 1\2 point plus grand.Une chance que ma soeur les voulait.Elle était parfaitement adaptée à son pied.
Love these shoes very nice and comfortable.  Looks  expensive  too.  I cant  say enough  about them.  I was glad they had 10.5 size  i can't  keep it to myself.  I am ordering  a pair for my daughter.  Its too comfortable  to just keep to myself
"Súper cómodos y muy bonitos!Soy talla 25, pedí 25.5 para no errar y me quedaron un poco grandes, pero muy bien"
Ultra confortable. Grandeur conforme au guide de taille. Très léger comme matériel. J'ai l'impression d'avoir les pieds sur de la mousse mémoire. J'adore !
The runners arrived as expected on time and in good condition.  They fit perfectly and are very comfortable.
Had to return them as they didn't fit and when I tried exchanging them they didn't have the colour in the size I needed. Great look though 👌
I bought this for my mom and she loved it. So comfortable and nice.
"Ich habe zwei Jacken bestellt, in Farben Limette und Grün. Die Farbe Limette ist wie abgebildet. Dies ist Geschmackssache. Was ich aber zu bemängeln habe, ist der Schnitt und vor allem die schlechte Qualität des Stoffes. Ich habe die gleiche Jacke (in grün), die ich schon vor ca. 4 Jahren in einem Store gekauft habe. Die ist mir Superbegleitung beim Regenwetter gewesen, nur ist sie etwas in die Jahre gekommen. Daher habe ich mir überlegt, noch eine zu kaufen, war aber sehr enttäuscht. Die grüne Farbe ist etwas abgewandelt, aber das ist nicht sehr dramatisch. Nur die alte Jacke war aus einem sehr angenehmen und weichen wasserabweisenden Stoff. Die Jacken, die ich hier bestellt habe, sind hart und daher stehen sie ab und schmiegen nicht an Körper. Ausserdem wurde offensichtlich der  Schnitt geändert. Die Größe 36 sitzt jetzt anders, enger, unbequemer (auch des Stoffes wegen) und im Brustbereich extrem eng. Außerdem fehlen an der Jacke unter den Achseln zwei Öffnungen zur Durchlüftung. Sehr schade. Die Jacken gehen sofort zurück."
"Die angegebenen Maße stimmen leider überhaupt nicht. Habe statt 48/50 schon 56!!! bestellt. Und mehr geht leider nicht.Lt. eigener BMS-Größentabelle im Umfang 140 cm.Nachgemessen leider nur knapp130 cm. 10cm !!! weniger.Klingt gut, wenn man sagt, wie liefern bis 56.Aber genaugenommen ist es nur eine ganz knappe 48/50.Schade, das man da nicht genauer arbeitet oder zumindest die Angaben richtig macht.Und...OekoTexSiegel und dann kein Baumwollinnenfutter(wie fast alle Mitbewerber), sondern Nylon?Schade,war zwar die teuerste aber trotzdem mein Favorit,bei meiner Jackenauswahl.Anmerkung: 2 Flyer plus 2 A4 Hochglanz/4-Farbdruck Produktblätter plus 1 A4 Hochglanz-OekoCertifikate plus 1 A4 Umweltinfo-Blatt  plus ein 42-seitiger Katalog(in welchem die kompletten Infos der losen Blätter bereits sowieso enthalten sind) relativieren für mich ein eigentlich lobenswertes Engagement für Umweltschutz.Völlig Überflüssig !!!"
"Zunächst das Positive. Das Material fasst sich sehr gut an, riecht nicht und hat keinerlei Knitterfalten nach dem Transport. Die Farbe ist ein sattes Melonenrot, wirklich schön. Habe 2 Nummern größer bestellt und die Größe passt perfekt. Sie ist hinten länger und sieht wirklich gut aus. Sie hat tiefe Taschen, in die allerhand reinpasst. Als  Regenjacke kann ich sie aber überhaupt nicht empfehlen. Ich war 10 Min. bei leichtem Regen unterwegs und komplett nass an den Unterarmen und vor allem an den Schultern. Jeder Windzug geht durch. Der Futterstoff innen ist glatt und kühl. Das ist unangenehm vor allem in den Taschen. Nach dem Tragen braucht die Jacke ewig zum Trocknen. Ich habe Regenjacken für 1/3 des Preises, die funktionieren. Dies war ein Fehlkauf und ist einfach nur eine übermäßig teure rote Jacke. Schade."
"Die Jacke ist echt hübsch.  Weil Leute schrieben, man soll sie größer bestellen, hab ich schon befürchtet, dass meine normale Größe zu klein sein würde und habe gleich 2 Jacken in Gr 52 und 54 bestellt.  Normalerweise trage ich eine 46/48. Ich hatte den Plan, einen dicken Wollpulli drunter zu ziehen.  Aber die 52 - also 2 Nummern größer  - ist einfach zu eng. Die 54 passt, aber mit Pulli wäre es zu eng. Habe beide zurück geschickt und jetzt eine 56 bestellt.An sich eine wunderschöne Jacke, die gut verarbeitet ist.  Das Material ist etwas steif. Die Farbe und Verarbeitung sind top. Aber die Größenangabe stimmt einfach nicht.Eine Nummer größer bedeutet dann aber auch, dass die Ärmel entsprechend länger sind.  Was sich auf dem Rad dann allerdings auszahlt.  Aber die Schultern sind halt auch breiter.  Aber mir gefällt die Jacke trotz dieser (grössentechnischen) Mängel sehr und ich freue mich auf die Lieferung der größeren Jacke. Das Ding ist schon ein Hingucker mit den Pünktchen."
"Kaufe nur noch BMS Gummistiefel, weil mich die Qualität einfach überzeugt. Die sind zwar nicht gerade günstig, aber jeden Cent wert, wie ich finde. Sie sind elastisch (bleiben auch an kühleren Tagen ""weich"", haben einen relativ kurzen und weiten Schaft, so dass Hosen locker reinpassen und auch kräftigere Beine gut Platz haben und sich die Kinder super darin bewegen können. Die Sohle ist schön flexibel und Schweißfüße gibt es auch nicht (von innen mit ganz dünnem Baumwollgewebe ausgekleidet). Absolut wasserdicht, tolle Farben, guter Sitz. Dadurch dass die Gummistiefel so flexibel sind (Sohle und auch Schaft) und nicht so hoch, können die Kinder super darin laufen und trampeln nicht durch die Gegend. Leicht an- und auszuziehen."
"Wir sind sehr enttäuscht! Die Stiefel 2x angehabt, 2x nasse Füße bekommen. Als Mutter eines kleinen Kindes bin ich sehr enttäuscht, schließlich kauft man Gummistiefel, damit die Kinderfüsse trocken bleiben und nicht umgekehrt.  Es reicht aus, wenn es draußen etwas frischer ist, bei nassen Füssen ist eine Erkältung vorprogrammiert. In der Corona-Zeit sehr ""erfreulich"".  Wenn man die Stiefeln betrachtet, findet man keinen Mangel. Der wird bei der Berührung der Stiefel mit dem Wasser gezeigt. Es war nicht einfach die Kontaktdaten des Verkäufers zu finden. Ich würde am liebsten 0 Sterne geben.Update: Der Verkäufer ist Toj Skandinavian Kids Fashion, vertrieben durch KK-Trade GmbH. Offensichtlich werden über dieses Angebot Stiefeln verschiener Verkäufer vertrieben."
"Nach den vorherigen Bewertungen habe ich den Mantel 3-4 Größen größer bestellt und das war wirklich gut so.So sitzt er perfekt und ich kann noch dicke Pullover darunter tragen. Die Kapuze ist etwas klein, vor allem, wenn man eine Mütze darunter trägt.Dafür habe ich mir aber schon seit längerem einen wasserdichten Südwester zugelegt. Der Mantel und Regenhut  sind eine unschlagbare Kombi.Den Mantel konnte ich auf mehreren mehrstündigen Regentouren auf seine Wasserdichte testen und bin vollstens zufrieden, da nicht ein Tropfen durch kam.Der Mantel wirkt sehr wertig und schön verarbeitet. Sonst habe ich in wasserdichten Regenjacken das Gefühl in einer Plastetüte zu stecken, aber das ist hier nicht der Fall."
"Ich suche für unsere Kinde stets Schuhe die dem Fuß viel Freiraum bieten, minimal oder auch Barfusschuhe sind mir am liebsten. Diese Stiefel sind sehr leicht und wirklich für Gummistifel sehr flexibel, hängen nicht wie ein Klotz am Bein. Was mich sehr stört ist das oben kein Stoff ist mit Kordel zum zu ziehen damit kein wasser/Dreck in die Schuhe kommt. Das passiert bei meiner Tochter immer wieder und nervt sie. Da man das aber ja auch auf dem Foto sieht ziehe ich dafür keinen Stern ab, eben gekauft wie gesehen (-; Die Stiefel riechen absolut gar nicht nach Chemie, das ist klasse. Allerdings ""fressen"" sich Erdspuren in die Farbe des Stiefels ein, ähnlich wie bei Kleidung, das finde ich bei Gummistifeln weniger schlimm da sie ja eh nicht zum schick sein gedacht sind (-:"
"Super verarbeitetSieht hochwertig ausIst komplett wasserdichtHält auch den Wind ab, hält dadurch ziemlich warm. Ich trage sie bis ca 7 grad (mit einer fleecejacke darunter) und das ist vollkommen in Ordnung.Sie ist seit dem Kauf in ständigem Gebrauch, ich kann dir weiter empfehlen.Größe 38 bestellt, weicht von der 36 nicht allzu viel ab. Sie passt, wer es gern etwas weiter mag, nimmt lieber eine Nummer größer."
"Ich habe mich entschieden diese Gummistiefel für mein Kind zu kaufen, um die giftigen Inhaltsstoffe anderer Marken zu meiden. Wenn man daran glaubt, verdient ein Gummistiefel ohne gesundheitsgefährdende Stoffe natürlich einen Bonusstern. Farbe, Funktion und Bequemlichkeit sind ebenfalls super. Deutliche Abzüge gibts von mir wegen der Haltbarkeit. Nach 18 Monaten hat ein Schuh einen langen wasserdurchlässigen Riss ohne dass die Schuhe mit etwas anderem als Sandkastensand und Plastikspielzeug in Kontakt gekommen wären. Für diejenigen die darauf spekulieren dürfen, dass das Kind nach 18 Monaten eh eine neue Schuhgröße brauch kann ich eine Kaufempfehlung geben. Für alle anderen eher nicht."
"Normally I fit 8.5 true to size but this time I'd try to half size up because these would be my beaters and I'm 17 still growing and when I got them they feel fit like an 8.5. Still satisfied with what came in looks amazing just a little size problem. If you're gonna go true to size, go half up. ;)"
"The way the materials are put together inside shoe, it's very uncomfortable, not smooth. Cuts left foot where foot and toes come together. If I'd tried them on in a store I would have been able to feel it and not purchase. Not like the others I've bought before like these that I really liked. Won't buy another pair. Will look for another brand, probably in a store where I can try on. Disappointing since I've really loved this brand and style before"
"Bought these as a gift for my fiancee because heoves this brand and shoe style! He loves them!!!! He opened the box and was so happy. They fit perfect and as expected!!  Must buy! If you checking them out, don't hesitate, BUY !!"
"I've worn Reebok Classics size 7.5 for decades. Oddly, for the past 18 months, my feet have been growing and I've changed to size 8, then 8.5 and now size 9. Still happy with the shoes."
These shoes are great. They are very comfortable for walking. And a perfect fit/size.
Had the shoes a long time ago do you still feel great
I have bought this model 5 times and now quality very disappointed. The nose of the sneaker came off after couple wearing. Cant contact with customer service and solve this problem(
Es perfecto como la descripción
Leather item not fake. I pretty much like just everything about them.  Will be a little bit better when they stretch some.
On their way back.  Ive always worn these and this pair was much narrower than I remember. I question authenticity.
"Diseño antiguo y calidad regular para el precio que tienen. No me han gustado nada, son más feas y simples en mano que en la foto. No las recomiendo. Eso sí, el tamaño habitual encaja perfectamente."
"Icvh habe schon einige Schuhe von Andrea Conti und war immer sehr zufrieden. Dieser Sneaker hat aber einen ganz anderen Schnitt, er ist vorne so eng da man überhaupt nicht hineinkommt. Außerdem fällt er viel kleiner aus."
"Article encore plus jolie qu'en photo, chaussure au top"
"Fatal. Pague envió rápido (3 días) y me tardo casi un mesPor otro lado el producto bien, original y todo eso"
The sneakers smelled like plastic/synthetic not like authentic leather.
"I love Dolce Vita shoes and sneaks! These are no exception! However, I did have to exchange for a 1/2 size smaller from 6.5 to a 6. Not sure if my feet shrunk or these run a little big. I'm usually a true 6.5 in DV footwear!  Great style with the slight platform and I love the canvas and snake print mix media!"
"I love how comfortable they are and so cute. I think they run a little big but, since they lace up it’s not that big of a deal."
I thought they were tieless laces but they are not.
Good
Cute style and very comfortable
Schöne warme Stiefel für Arbeiten im Freien.
Ich habe ein paar Flip Flops fürs schwimmen meiner Tochter gesucht die ihr gefallen und wo der Preis stimmt. Die Lieferung kam wie versprochen und sie sehen auch wie auf dem Bild auf. Meine Tochter hat die 33 und ich habe sie in 33/34 bestellt. Passen super und hat auch noch etwas platz. Denke eine Nummer Größer wäre dann zu groß. Sie stinken nicht also super. Ich würde sie wieder kaufen und meine Tochter ist happy.
"Muy bonitas, flexibles y cómodas. Son las mejores, las más duraderas. Yo he repetido compra para mi hija por eso, porque ella estropea mucho los zapatos normalmente, pero estas se la han quedado pequeñas  y están nuevas, y eso que también las usa para piscina todo el año! Recomiendo pedir un número más pq dan poca talla. El precio por 13€ genial!!"
"Das Material ist etwas fester als bei anderen FlipFlops, daher sind sie -wie bei uns genutzt- als Badeschuhe perfekt geeignet, da sie kein Wasser ""aufsaugen"". Für längeres Tragen sicher nicht so optimal, weil man dadurch eher schwitzt."
"Ich liebe die Ipanemas und meine Mädchen auch. Sie tragen sie seit Größe 22 !Allerdings weise ich hier daraufhin, dass meine jetzt 5jährige Tochter die deutsche Größe 27/28 trägt. Bei den Ipanemas braucht sie aber in deutscher Größe mindestens 28/29."
Estupendas
Superschöner Kinder Flip Flop sitzt fest am Fuß und gibt guten Halt durch die zwei Riemchen. Unsere Tochter trägt 32 diese hier habe ich in 33/34 gekauft und es passt perfekt
"Molto carini sono piaciuti a mia figlia, solo non calzano molto si può prendere anche un numero più grande e hanno una bella forma del piede"
"Super bequemer Schuh. Tolle Optik, super leicht. Konnte ihn direkt für einen langen Spaziergang anziehen.Ein Stern Abzug weil immer die Sohle mit rauskommt wenn man die Schuhe auszieht."
Riekerschuhe sitzen immer perfekt und sind mega bequem.Größe 37 ist auch  Größe 37.
Toller Schuh! Passform ok. Das gelb gefällt mir besonders gut!
Wunderbar leichter Schuh mit einer angenehmen Innensohle. Tolle Farbe. Ich trage sie als bequeme Hausschuhe.
"Schöner Schuh, leider nichts für breitere Füße"
Super bequemer Schuh.
"Super Schuh. Schöne Farbe, sehr bequem gut verarbeitet. Würde ich wieder kaufen."
"Farbe wie abgebildet, leider rollt sich die Schuheinlage beim gehen zusammen, da sie nur eingelegt ist."
Sehr bequeme Schuhe
Alles super - vielen Dank - gerne wieder
"La scarpa è bella, leggera, cool, ma purtroppo la taglia è davvero INDICATIVA. I 25 cm segnati sull'etichetta sono in realtà 26 e oltre. Occhio alla misura."
se las compre a mi hija y dice que son muy comodas y muy bonitas
Muy mala calidad puestas 2 veces y ya estan como viejas.
"These shoes are cool in that if your kid is crappy at tying shoes, the shoes stay on whether or not they are tied.I was afraid the fit was going to be too snug but he was able to pull them on easily .  I'm going to preface my criticism with this: my son is hard on his shoes; he runs in his runner's club about a 1.5 miles a day and then plays hard the rest of the time,so,the laces didn't last two weeks, after about two months these are looking a bit worn and frayed on the upper near the toe, really its cosmetic.The sole is holding true its not pulling way or peeling like cheaper shoes do. the tread looks good  there is a lot of wear in the midfoot on the insert of the shoe so I am curious how long until the midfoot  cushioning starts to break down, so far so good they just look beat."
When I saw these sneakers I had to get them because I love the way they looked.. but it fit my son feet some what small which I'm not thrilled about that because on the website said it runs true to size I did not want to even bother sending it back so I just gave it to my nephew..
"These shoes looks super cute online, but the toe part is long and makes them look weird on my sons feet. But the bigger draw back is that on the inside of the heel is the bubble like cushion that sticks out like a 1/2 inch. He said it was very uncomfortable and rubbed on him."
"Cute and fun! Definitely not a shoe to run in, but good enough to throw on for errands. Fit a little big, but was expecting that."
My son has two pairs of these shoes. He loves them and he wears them all the time. We have taken them to Disney and Universal multiple times and he says they are extremely comfy.
"Unfortunately these shoes runs very big, I really liked the color and material but their is no support on your feet when you walk/run or while doing any kind of sport"
My only complaint is that the tongue is attached to the sides of the shoe and can't be pulled up to make it easier to put the shoe on.  Other than that (and I understand that is becoming a common feature in athletic shoes) I like them just fine.
"Habe mir den Schuh zum kleinen Preis bestellt, wirklich prima ist das neue Futter. Megaweich sogar die Sohle. Allerdings sollte man für diesen Schuh keine zu breiten Füße haben. Ich selbst habe schmale Füße und mir passt er prima. Die Farbe braun stimmt so nicht ist eher olivgrün. Gefällt mir aber recht gut. Absolute Weierempfehlung von mir."
"Belli, leggeri e morbidi all interno.... Calzano un po' piccoli... Consiglio numero più grande.... Presi in saldo, sodisfatta...."
"Sehr schöner und gut verarbeiteter Araschuh. Material weich und angenehme Luftpolstersohle, Klasse Farbe, wirkt sportlich. Leider war der Schuh, trotz richtig bestellter Größe zu klein musste zurück geschickt werden. Schade."
No es la talla correcta. Indica 42'5 y en la caja de indica 40'5. Una pena.
Tutto okay...
"Gute Qualität, Größe passt, angenehm zu tragen, Rot entspricht dem auf dem Foto, in Summe wirkt der Schuh jedoch am Fuß ""etwas ältlich"""
"Fidèles aux photos, belle qualité. La semelle est amovible et vous pouvez donc mettre la votre si nécessaire.Confortable même pour pieds larges."
Super bequem. Sehr gute Qualität
Sehr schöner Schuh
"Nachdem ich inzwischen bereits diverse Turnschuhe der Marke Nike bestellt und anprobiert habe, muss ich sagen, dass es mich nicht wundert, dass die hier vorliegenden ""Nike FS Lite Run 2 Damen Laufschuhe"" auch nicht passen, denn anscheinend hat sich die generelle Unsitte der zu kleinen Turnschuhe eingebürgert, was sehr ärgerlich ist, ich meine, wenn man als Frau schon Größe 43 (!) bestellen muss, obwohl man normalerweise 2 Schuhgrößen kleiner trägt, und die dann auch nicht passen, ich hätte wahrscheinlich 44 oder 45 gebraucht!, das ist schon mehr als grenzwertig, normal ist für meine Begriffe anders. Ich frage mich, warum die Turnschuhhersteller an ihren Kunden vorbei produzieren, das kann es doch nicht sein! Aber bei den anderen großen Sportschuhanbietern ist es das gleiche Trauerspiel. Dabei sind gerade in dieser und der letzten Saison die Modelle so farbenfroh wie nie und man würde gerne sogar mehrere Paare kaufen, aber sie müssten natürlich passen, das tun sie aber nicht. Entweder drücken sie vorne von oben auf den großen Zeh herunter, was schmerzt, oder sie sind zu kurz und drücken, schmerzen ebenfalls, oder sie sind insgesamt am Spann viel zu niedrig, so dass man bei geschnürtem Schuh immer noch eine super breite Schnürlasche hat, von weitem sieht das dann aus, als hätte man Elefantenfüße, weil die Schuhe zu wenig Material haben um ganz geschlossen zu werden und das bei mir, die ich superschlanke Füße habe und jahrelang Ballett getanzt habe, einfach skandalös! M.E. sollten die Nike Leute ihren Produzenten mal neue Schuhformen spendieren, die hier scheinen noch aus einem anderen Kulturkreis zu stammen in dem man Puppenfüßchen hat, aber nicht die Füße einer großen, westeuropäischen Frau!"
"Dieser Schuh ist ein Traum für große und etwas breitere (keine zierlichen) Damenfüße, die ein paar Kilos mehr tragen müssen.Super bequem, trage sie den ganzen Tag bei der Arbeit, in der Freizeit, zum Nordic Walking, auf längeren Ausflügen, zum Shoppen.Hab sie mir in drei verschiedenen Farbvarianten geholt. Für die Farbkombi habe ich schon viele Komplimente bekommen! Toll für den Sommer!"
"Ich habe den Schuhe bereits in zwei Farben, weil er einfach gut sitzt und dabei auch noch sehr schön ist. Ich trage die Schuhe sowohl als Sportschuh und als Alltagsschuh. Ein super schöner und bequemer Schuh den ich mir immer wieder kaufen würde."
"Sieht super das, passt perfekt und meine Tochter ist glücklich. Sie hat Gr.35 und der Schuh 35,5 passt sehr gut. Das Laufgefühl ist auch sehr gut."
Der Schuh ist super bequem und sieht auch gut aus.Allerdings habe ich eine Nummer größer bestellt.Ich habe eigentlich 39 und habe jetzt 40 genommen und er passt super!!
Okk
"Ganz tolle Nike Schuhe!Größe passte wie immer perfekt, geniale Farben und einfach ein Traum was den Tragekomfort angeht!!!Würde sie mir auf jeden Fall wieder kaufen :)"
Super toller Schuh! Passt super. Sehr schöne Qualität. Sehr bequem zu tragen. Man läuft wie auf Wolken! Nur zu empfehlen
good condition
its nice and comfortable.
"They are equal parts too big and too small. The proportions of these shoes are so off that the strap on the left was tight while the one on the right was super loose. They are pretty comfortable, the middle piece between my toes kind of hurt, but nothing the I wouldn't get used to. Over all these shoes are ok, someone will love them: they just aren't for me."
These suck! I loved the look so I ordered a pair. Loved them (and hadn’t had them long at all) then they came unstitched by the elastic. I thought maybe I did something wrong so I ordered another pair and everything was going great and it just happened again yesterday. Not only am I so so disappointed bc they are apparently not good quality but these were the cutest and went with everything! It makes me mad because I loved them so much
"They are well made, but the finger separator is too sturdy. It hurts so much I can't wear them, even if I put bandages all over my fingers. I get a lot of blisters. It is impossible to loosen this thing up, especially during hot summers, when the feet swell. At this point they can only be a house decoration."
"For the price, these shoes are great.  I ordered my normal size and they fit perfectly.  The straps feel extremely sturdy and they are pretty comfortable for being a flat shoe with little support.  The only complaint I have is that the bottoms of them is pretty slick."
I ordered a size 11 and the shoe itself fit perfectly. But the strap with the buckle was way to short to go around my ankle. HOWEVER the straps were so soft and the shoes so comfortable I still recommend them. Just for people with smaller feet. I have never had a problem wearing anklets.
"They were a bit tight in the toe area,but they were cute and didn’t give me any blisters wearing them throughout the day! I was able to take them to the water as well and it didn’t damage the sole"
I was not feeling the color but I bought anyway. I run between a 6.5 and a 7 size. I ordered a 7 and they were way too small. I could have easily gotten an 8. I just gave them to my daughter instead of returning
"The footbed has minimal cushioning, but enough to keep your foot from sliding around.  The toe separator could be more comfortable.  They seem well made enough.  They're cute.  They're $10.  The sizing runs maybe a tiny bit small.  I usually wear an 11 in a shoe, and I often can get away with a 10 in sandals.  I got the 11 and was glad that I did.  The 10 would have been way too small."
"These are a steal! If you hate stiff, flat sandals then this is your answer. Super soft straps, thin but cushioned sole. My feet are very wide/thick and these are just perfect sandals for me. Wish they came in more colors!"
It’s not black. It’s dark blue. It first came a size ten. The bag said 7 but clearly it was a size 10. I would give it a worse rating for that part but it’s actually a cute sandal. I prefer the navy blue and it’s comfortable so I can’t rate it lower. I like what I got and it’s great quality.
Passt perfekt für mein Sohn
cette paire plait énormément à mon garçon de 10 ans et pourtant c'est compliqué de lui trouver des baskets qui lui plaisent
Never ordered shoes online as I like to fit them first.  I have had asics in the past so I hoped they be the same as in the past as far as fit.  They fit great and are comfortable.  I am a smaller adult so my 5.5 size shoes are hard to find in stores unless I go to young boys shoes and the selection there isnt the greatest for adult colors.  I like them!
My daughter absolutely loves them. She had the black pair for last season and outgrew them so she got the white ones and they fit perfect and looked sharp with her uniform!
Excellent starter pair for my kid to wear for their first volleyball season.
So happy with my purchase! I needed to buy slip ons after my shoulder surgery and these are the best! Great shoe for price!!
These shoes are absolutely fabulous! They are lightweight and have great support and they are very comfortable. I just absolutely love them!
The shoe is super comfortable and lightweight for walking.The eyelets for the shoelace are very thin and I’m not sure they are going to last if you try and tighten up the laces with repeated use and only time will tell. I purchased the navy blue ones and they have normal eyelets.
"Wear these no socks.  Massage therapist. Want more black my size (41/women’s 10) and some water proof.With Essentrics exercise, these are the best thing for balance, for my work and even walking the dogs!"
I needed a second pair of sneakers for work & soooo happy I bought these... very comfy
"Le he comprado estas Playeras  a mi hijo que usa el 40 e igual le quedan un pelin grandes pero un casi nada, son muy bonitas con vaqueros  y muy comadas"
"alles gut, Grüße und Passform sind wie erwartet, Farbe entspricht der Erwartung.  Für einen nicht zu breiten Fuß prima geeignet. Stabile Verabeitung."
"Ottima qualità, mio figlio contentissimo della scelta, molto soddisfatto"
"Sehr gute Qualität, so wie ich sie von geox gewohnt bin.Würde ich wieder kaufenSpitzen Preis-LeistungsverhältnisDanke"
"Soft, comfortable and beautiful shoes with a good fit.  The boy is overjoyed and happy and so am I.  Thanks so much."
Der Schuh ist für diesen Preis sensationell.
"PRODOTTO DI OTTIMA  QUALITA'. CALZA IN MODO PIU' O MENO GIUSTO : PER CAPIRCI IN CONFRONTO AD UN'ALTRA CALZATURA DELLO STESSO NUMERO, CALZA UN PO' PIU' STRETTA. MA NEL COMPLESSO VA BENE."
Son cómodas y de calidad. Buenos materiales y buen envio
Schöne Schuhe. Sitzen sehr gut und gefallen dem Kind.
"Scarpe curate nel minimo dettaglio, fatte veramente bene, sono pienamente soddisfatto!!!"
"Super Qualität und gut verarbeitet. Macht einen rubusten und hochwertigen eindruck. Das Fußbett, die Sohle und das Leder sind sehr weich. Mein Kind hat keine Druckstellen an dwn Füßen navh dem tragen. Außerdem gibt der Schu einen guten Halt und sieht hübsch aus. Die Größe fällt normal aus. Ich kann den Schuh empfehlen und würde ihn wieder kaufen."
"Die Farbe ist viel hübscher als erwartet. Mehr Beere als Rot. Macht einen sehr guten Eindruck, gute Passform. Unser Mädchen zieht sie gerne an."
"Comode, morbide. Ottimo acquisto"
"Me enviaron la talla equivocada! Yo ordene 23mex. 6ame. Y llegó en 22, y todo esto hasta México así que no puedo enviarlos de regreso, también rompieron la caja en aduana así que ni caja original tengo!estoy tan desepcionada de verdad me gusta mucho el model, la calidad es buena no tengo quejas, es una moneda al aire."
"Los tenis bien,  el tamaño mal.  No le pongo 5 estrellas porque 2 veces me enviaron mal la talla. La primera vez pedí 3.5 y me mandaron 2.5 y los tuve que regresar, la segunda ocasión pedí 4.5 y llego 3."
"These shoes were very nice but I ordered a half size larger as recommended by most of the reviews and they were definitely too big. I would say order your usual size. I did feel like the shoes had a bit of a forward tilt, which is maybe helpful for some avid runners? It felt unfamiliar to me so I did not re-order in my correct size. However, very stylish and appeared to be of good quality."
"Fit me well. I got a size 10 wide and they are comfy with plenty of room in the toe box. Its too cold to hike right now though so I'll have to wait to get a true assessment. But walking on city streets is comfortable, with no pinch point or tight spots."
"No he encontrado ni una sola review de éstas botas, ni siquiera existen para el fabricante, aunque el vendedor las describe como aptas para practicar el trail running. No se debería practicar ningún tipo de ejercicio con ellas, son inestables y el drop es demasiado alto. Perfectas para pasear, aunque cuidado en verano, el pié puede alcanzar la temperatura del sol. No las recomiendo en absoluto, he tenido que pagar gastos de envio para recibirlas, ya que confié en la descripción y es totalmente errónea. Ahora a pagar también para devolverlas. Tardaron tres semanas y además el transportista se negó a subirlas a casa porque ""estaba muy alto"". Toda una odisea. No compro más zapatillas en Amazon, mientras permitan la venta de éstos productos sin control de calidad, en este caso de falsedad. Una vergüenza."
"Están muy bonitos, pero me mandaron la talla equivocada, se me hace injusto que esto pase en todos los pedidos, ya que la mayoría de los comentarios mencionaron este inconveniente, pensé que tendría suerte pero no fue así, pedí 24 y me llegaron del 23. Los tendré que devolver ."
"They are by far the more uncomfortable shoes ever!! Made for all terrain is correct , but more of a outdoor rough hike or shore walk along a rugged beach!!!I tried , and struck out , worn and can't return. If looking for comfort, run, run far away , use whatever is covering then toes not a bolt in the opposite direction!! Now Go!!!"
"I returned so many because the size was wrong, but this one is good . perfect fit . I Order a 9.5 size and it fit with bigger socks in Fall .  I usually wear a size 9 (41EU) ."
"Son lindos, bien hechos pero son muy estrechos. Compre un 23 y termine regresandolo. Posteriormente compre un 23.5 y ese si me quedo bien. Compren una talla más."
"A pesar de ver los comentarios  referentes a qué las tallas llegaban mal decidí confiar y probar suerte y en efecto llegan mal las tallas, no compren con estos vendedores  es mi recomendación.  el producto es bueno los humanos al seleccionar el número correcto son pésimos al parecer."
Without  socks  upper weave rub my foot. Beautiful shoe. Hated to return them.
very comfortable and cute!
Comodissime grazie alla misura L non facile da trovare in altre marchePiù leggere dei modelli precedenti (Tour 360)Vedremo la tenuta nel tempo
"Achetée en pointure 48. Dommage qu'Adidas ne les propose pas en France !!!Taille bien adaptée, chaussure légère et confortable"
"After a couple wears this becomes an extremely comfortable spikeless golf shoe. They fit a little snug, but relaxes after a while. I won't wear these in wet, soggy conditions because I don't feel the traction would hold up with mud caked on the bottom. I've played two rounds in semi dry ground and the shoes were perfect. Only complaint - the tongue can be a bit stiff and can be annoying if not flattened out. Other than that it's a great, stylish, comfortable summer golf shoe"
"These are by far the most comfortable golf shoes I've ever owned, and possibly the most comfortable shoes of any kind that I currently own. The fit is perfect, and I love that they are so lightweight. I sometimes buy wide shoes because some designs are too narrow, but I got the standard width and it is perfect. I was unsure how I would like a spikeless design, but stability and traction were great. Combined with the amazing comfort, I will never go back to spikes. Once you try these, neither will you."
"Wow, I just finished 18 holes today with my new Adidas S2g golf shoes and they get an A+ for comfort, fit, and water repellant.  I can’t remember the last time I put on a pair of shoes out of the box and felt completely comfortable wearing them.  4 hours walking the course and they were great from start to finish.  I hope this model is available when I need a new pair because these are worth a “Will buy again” rating!"
"Nice quality shoe but I have a couple problems with it that lead to a 2 start rather than 5.  BOA is using string instead of wire which it normally does and you’re not able to get a proper tight fit. Second biggest issue is the fabric of the shoe lens it self to bunching up when you try to tighten it. One of the biggest issues is the tongue of the shoe is too puffy so when the BOA strings is trying to tighten it has to fight the puffiness, which lends to a loose fit.  Folks who love and use BOA on their shoes will understand. Last major issue which is the shoe doesn’t have enough arch support, atleast IMHO. On the plus side the sole of the shoe is one of the nicest I’ve seen, but at this point, I’ll probably stick with Puma or FootJoy."
"Needed to replace my spikeless Nikes that had no grip left (Nike Roche G, so not much spikiness on the bottom to begin with).Played my first 18 with these today. They did the job pretty well. They were a little stiff at first, but broke in and softened up in no time at all. I love the new BOA style tying mechanism. It's fun to just pull the knob up and flop your shoes off. They have great grip on the bottom, I felt very stable in my swings.I'd like them to have maybe just a little bit more cushioning. Nikes had a lot of suishy bounce in them. Don't get me wrong, they're definitely comfy. Nice and roomy. Played a full round and had zero comfort issues.Overall, really happy with these!"
"Bought these because my Nikes (while really nice) make my feet ridiculously hot in the Florida weather. These shoes are definitely not for wet weather, but man are they comfortable! They seem like they will breathe really well, but only time will tell. I am very happy with the fit. I’m a 12.5 in all adidas shoes so I knew what size to order and they fit perfectly."
"Tried four different golf shoes, $200 range,  for the other named brand shoes.  This golf shoe won hands down on comfort, stability and fit.  Also, outstanding waterproofing that proved itself beyond my expectations.  Very much worth the money and style is great as well.  Great shoe to double for street walking."
"This is my third pair of Adidas golf shoes I have bought in the past six months.  I play year round, walk and carry my bag so fit and comfort is critical.  First two pairs are great so I expected the same with this pair.  Received them on Sunday and played in them on Tuesday.  After 12 holes my feet felt as if I was playing in leather soled dress shoes.  My heels are very low in the shoe and the ball of the feet feel bruised.  The support and comfort is completely different from my first two pairs of Adidas.  I will need to add inserts to play in these again.  Same price as the first two but comfort is not comparable."
"Absolutely comfortable right out of the box. Have been looking for comfortable sneakers that are not clunky and heavy like reebock,which I had been wearing. These are stylish and sooooo comfortable and not heavy, like walking on air.  Winner for sure!"
Five stars for sure!!This is my second pair of Propet and I think I'm in love just wore these for the first timeto an amusement park.  After thousands of steps my feet still felt like thy did when I left the house.They are my new go to.  I use my other pair for exercise walking. it's like walking on a cloud and guess what?I'm up to almost 3 miles but always do at least 1 1/2 to 2 each time out and my shoes are NEVER A PROBLEM.I like Skechers as well but these offer a unique kind of sturdiness and support that's very different.
"Wore these shoes for first time amd really like them. Very light weight and they are a bit large, because I ordered them half a size larger, so I could wear thicker socks. Worked out fine."
I ordered these in XX-wide and the toe box is not very wide. They are more wide in the middle of the shoe. These must be intended for swollen feet/ankles not wide feet.
"I have problems with my feet swelling inconsistently (from normal to 4E from day to day).  I purchased the 4E to fit the fattest my feet get, but when the swelling is less they fit too.  The tongue of the shoe is not attached to the sides of the shoe so gives you more space, and with the laces I can tighten the shoe to fit my foot.  I love these so much that I bought 3 colors so I have variety.  They are comfortable to walk in and give good support."
"The shoe was in the wrong box.  It was too small.  To return it, I had to take it to the USPS store which I could not get to.  So I have a pair of shoes for the trash.  Last time I buy shoes from amazon."
"I have wide feet, especially in the toes area.  I have a devil of a time finding shoes that don't cramp my toes.  Well, these did the trick for me.  They are good looking and comfortable.  Thank you thank you thank you."
"Lightweight but substantial! Fits well, but for a double extra wide, I've had wider shoes. Love the Prime Wardrobe try-before- you-buy option! Ensures you get what you're looking for!"
"Im in Love with these shoes...!..Ive been having lower back pain the last couple of months..I have bought several different types of walking shoes, Asics, Schetchers and tried On Cloud these are more comfortable. I nnormally wear a 9.5 or 10.. I decided to order 9.5  x-wide.. Ive never worn an xwide but i like the extra room i got with these..They fit perfect with plenty of room...I was worried they would old lady like, lol.. But i really like the look...And i’m even wanting to walk for exercise now..Highly recommend.."
Width good at 6XX but toe box hurts my little toe. Disappointed I had to return.
".Mooie sneakers, maar ze is jets te groot"
The back material is already ripped on both sandals.  They look like they are last year's shoes
My son always complains that shoes aren’t comfortable but he loves these and wears them every day. Great shoe that is also cool.
"I bought these for my son for Christmas, along with another pair that he liked more.  He has only worn these 3 times and it is already tearing at the toe tab. :*("
Love the look and the feel !
Knit shoe is real comfy.  The ortho sockliner is great.  Overall lots of cushion.  Not really the most athletic shoe but great daily wear.
"Fit good, came with no box. But brand new."
"My husband loves the style, the way the sneakers fit and the color, (burgundy) is so pretty.I definitely recommend this shoe!"
Love them
Feel great on
Distinguishably casual.
"Great sneakers comfortable, feels half size larger."
"I purchased a pair of these shoes for my 6 yr old son to wear to school. They arrived on time. Put them on him this morning to go to school and these are some sharp, snazzy looking tennis shoes! They looked awesome on him! They fit just as expected…. But if you are in between sizes, go with the larger size. Always.If I had one complaint about these shoes…. It would be on the top band where it says Afidas real big…. That part is semi snug on the kids foot. But after all, they are brand new and never been worn so maybe they just need a little time to get broken in some.Other than that, killer sharp little shoe!"
"My son HAD to have these. The sole is cheap foam....and the traction has completely worn off. The bottoms are completely smooth now. They have no laces, so now they've  stretched out so bad, they come off very easily. I would not recommend! I love Addidas, but for the price  these are a fail. /"
Got for my 8 year old. Love them.
They’re comfortable and easy to put on.  And stylish for my 4th-grade boy
"These shoes seem well made, and the length seems true to size. However, the band across the foot is extremely snug, and my child had trouble getting his foot into the shoe himself. When he did get his foot in, the shoe was quite narrow and pinched his toes on the sides of the toe box despite having plenty of length. He usually wears regular width shoes, but these were too narrow for him."
Second pair to own because they are comfortable. Easy to slide on. I  wear a women's size  6. I bought a kids 4 1/2 and it fits perfict
They fit well and are comfortable. My only complaint is that they aren’t as breathable as I would of liked.
My boys love these shoes.. it’s all they will wear!! They tear up fast if you have rough boys.. but you should expect that from anything with rough boys.. 🤷🏼‍♀️🤪
"Poor quality tip of sneaker ripping apart,  not durable at all after only a month. Bought for my 6 years old 1st grade girl. My other kids sneakers didn't do this all at."
Very soft sole. My 7 year old wore the sole out in less than 2 months.
"My son loves them, he thinks he can run faster with these on. They fit great, & seem durable and comfortable. Look great too."
Great shoes my son love it.
Comodidad
"Great shoe, arrived quite late but product is good"
Bought these for my daughter who absolutely loves them. She is a picky person when it comes to shoes because she has a wide foot which can be hard to find a good looking great fitting shoe. They are perfect for her and she said she never wants to take them off so in all I  am glad I bought them.
"Quality: These do not seem like authentic adidas. They have a very strange look in person. I do not like them at all and nor does my child.Fit: I wouldn’t recommend ordering these but if you do, make sure your kiddo has a narrow foot and order a half size up at least."
"My daughter really likes these shoes and does everything in them. It's just unfortunate that the shiny stripes started peeling off within the first week of wear. Now 3 are peeling off and flapping around and it just looks really sloppy, as though she's been wearing them for a couple years instead of a couple months! My mom got so concerned seeing the state of her shoes a couple weeks ago that she's ordering her another pair 🤣. But, other than making me look like a negligent mom, they're comfortable and lightweight and cute."
"Great looking shoe!  I love the look of these on my son.  As boys do though, he is pretty rough on clothes and shoes.  The fabric that covers the top of the toes (looks like of like mesh) got a couple of small holes in it after a couple of months and now after ~3-4 months of wearing them the entire piece of fabric on the top of the shoe is basically flapping in the breeze it's pulled back so far.  The actual shoe underneath the fabric still seems to be holding up ok, so I guess more of a cosmetic issue, but still annoying.  Not sure I'd buy these again simply because of that, but I did love them for the first couple of months!"
"I thought adidas would offer a quality material but my 6 year old son already was able to wear it out the tip of the shoes within two months. All he has been doing with the shoes is walking, running, biking , playing in recess outside in school. He does not play soccer so kicking or something like that is not the reason why the fronts torn out."
Looked great to start but after a few short weeks the front plastic toe started to crack open. Typical daily use! Would not recommend this product.
"The sandals were very cute, extremely undersized. My granddaughter wears a size 3 and these wouldn’t even go on her foot. She doesn’t have a wide foot so they should have at least went on width wise. To me they looked more like a size 1. I returned them. I had bought them for a trip and there wasn’t enough time to reorder."
Very narrow at the toes. The beading was already curling up when we received it. Poorly sewn. Very low quality materials. Had to return themRight away.
"When I saw the shoes I liked them because they would match a dress I bought for my daughter and I to have our family photos done. When the shoes arrived I was immediately disappointed at how the shoe felt over all. When I went to try them on my daughter, she couldn’t even slide her feet in because the straps at the front were too tight. I even put lotion on her feet to see if they would slide in easier and thought she just needed to break them in. My daughter started crying after having them on for less than 5 minutes. Her feet had the strap marks imprinted on the tops of her feet for about 30 minutes."
"My daughter is very petite and has little feet. We ordered the sandals and they are super cute but the straps that go over the foot are ridiculously small. My daughter’s foot wouldn’t fit. We exchanged for a larger size— the same problem! We have never run into this issue before with any shoes or sandals. Disappointed, as they are so adorable."
"Super cute shoes my granddaughter is wearing with her summer dress to a wedding. My daughter bought several sizes because we believed the reviews, just by your normal size."
"They are very pretty and stylish,  however, I had to get them a size bigger because the front of her foot would not go in properly."
"These LOOK cute, but the quality is terrible. One of the straps broke after a month....3 days after the return window. My 5yr old is so disappointed 😞  don't waste your money or time on these."
As far as the shoe size goes it is true to size but the strap over the toes is too tight. My child is pretty slim and doesn’t have fat feet so I think the toe strap area could be a bit bigger.
"These were really cute. However, they are too narrow so I had to return."
My daughter loves them!  Super sparkly and cute!!
"Qualität ist gut, roch etwas streng nach Gummi, haben ihn 1 Tag ausgelüftet vorm tragen,dann wär's gut. Guter Tragekomfort sagt mein Sohn,guter halt, Fussball Spielen im Garten geht auch,bisher keine Naht o.ä. gerissen, hält was aus! Sollte evtl 1 Nr grösser bestellt werden, fällt schmal aus, und eine 39 ist quasi eine 38,5.....ansonsten top!"
Buenísima calidad y son preciosas la talla es la que se usa habitual
Superschön. Toll ausgefallen. Schnelle Lieferung. Jederzeit wieder.
El diseño muy buenos pero las tallas confusas para mexico
"These are nice looking and feel solid, however, my right boot came with a 1"" long defect on the right side near the toe stitching that appears to have had an attempt to be ""fixed."" I'll be returning these unfortunately.**UPDATE 12/02/2018**  After some thinking and looking around for other black boots, I decided to give this pair another shot.  After all, I liked their look and design, and figured I should give them another try.  My new pair came basically free of any defects to the leather.  However, the white stitching around the toe area wasn't quite as clean and neatly done as I would expect from Ariat.  I know these are only $150, but still, this kind of issue should be easily preventable.  Other than that, these boots are very comfortable, and took very little time to break-in.  Maybe a couple of days.  And to get around the slippery leather sole, I took them to a Cobbler who applied a thin rubber layer over the leather sole.  It was a great fix that I had not previously heard of!  I hate leather soles."
These boots are comfortable and last a long time. Very well constructed.
Got as Christmas gift and got the same size as last pair. He loved them
Great boots
The boots look great. I accidentally ordered a EE in width but I’m glad I did because they are still a little tight.
"Okay - this may not be a name you are framiliar with, I was not.  But this is my second pair and finally I am not wearing out one side of my shoes and my feet no longer hurt.  I got my first pair from the orthopedic shoe / soles and am not looking back. Yes, I recomend this product."
Typical of most men - I buy the same shoe over and over again.
The sole is different but cures my issues with pain in my Achilles. I like the shoes very much and seem to be high quality
Sizing is right on. They are super comfortable and I feel like my posture is better when walking.
Acheté en rose elles sont parfaites. Comme sur la photo.Taille bien.Ma fille est ravie
Parfait ma fille fait 25 et je sais mettre un doigt derrière son talon.
A couple of friends praised Hoka’s and how comfortable they are so I decided to cough up the extra money for a pair since I have a bad knee. They are ok tennis shoes but the thick sole seems more for looks then comfort so value for money is a bit disappointing.
Voleci!! Ottimo!
"El envío tardó menos de lo esperado pero la caja venía en una bolsa y la caja estaba en un mal estado, los tenis no me quedaron bien por tener el empeine alto."
"Bought these to replace an old set.  Not the best looking, but they fit as expected and are well built turf boots."
Great cleat.. light weight .. great on the field turf.Only downfall... very difficult to get on because of the tight sock material on the ankle.. have to use a shoehorn to get them on.  Know way I was fitting my foot through there.  Overall very pleased with the product
Tal y como lo esperaba
It was good
The good - shoe is light and flexible with enough padding in the heel so you don’t bruise your heel when playing on really hard fields. Length was true to size. Fun colorThe bad - I stopped wearing them after five practices due to how hard they are to get on. Takes forever to get my feet through the upper sock that’s attached to the shoe. They made it too small without enough stretch. Some type of neoprene would have been a better choice vs ribbed cotton. The shoe itself is A bit narrow even for a medium width foot. They weren’t painfull  but they weren’t comfortable either.
"They arrived a day before a soccer tournament I had, they feel extremely good, the built in compression socks, is really comfortable, I used them in real grass with some patches and didn't have any issues with the traction and hold in on, I also tend to slide a little bit the foot and when having to accelerate didn't have any problem. After like 20 minutes of playing I start having blisters on my backheel, I think I still have to break them in, but meanwhile they look amazing, they have really nice traction, I'm hoping they can break in quickly."
Great shoe for turf fields. My only issue is that you must wear socks the come well over the ankle cuff and they have to be on the thicker side or the shoe will rub your achilles raw. Otherwise the shoes offer good support and I'm very pleased with them.
"I normally am a size 12-13 so I went with a 12.5.  It is hard to buy shoes online without trying them on first, so I gave it a go.  I took them out for a game last night.  They are very comfortable for turf, however, given the large size, my touch was heavy and I couldn't connect with long passes (getting under the ball).  My lesson learned, try the size before you buy."
Runs huge. Returned three times for different sizes until the size was decent. No support on footbed. Not impressed. Their market should stick to outdoors cleats of which Adidas is king! (Although the newer version of beloved outdoor clear Nemesis 19.3 is terrible on the ankle support. Please go back to the 18.3! None of the travel soccer boys like the new version.)
I wanted a nice tennis shoe for the fall and this fit the bill. I love the colors and they’re comfortable too. I listened to the other buyers and bought a smaller size to be safe. I wear a 7 and bought it in a 6.5 and it’s a good fit.
"They run SO big. I wear an 8.5. Ordered these shoes and they fit more like a 9 or 9.5. I recommend going at least one size down.These shoes are cute, but they look very bulky on my feet."
Beautiful sneaker! Very comfortable! Runs a full size large. I normally wear 9.5-10 but found that a 9 was the best fit in this style. Color is beautiful dusty rose.
Ya tenía unos en otro color pero con el cambio de uniforme necesite estos y como si los hubiera comprado en Adidas
"I’d been eyeing these are they are unbelievable. Seller was awesome, quick shipping.  Get them!!!"
"They have great arch support and I love the color. A bit tight on my right heal, but long socks help relieve that."
"I usually wear a 7.5-8. Based on other reviews I ordered a half size smaller and went with a 7. These fit pretty well, however I think a 6.5 may have been too small. I absolutely love love love these shoes. I want a pair in every single color. Great quality, stylish, lots of compliments."
Love these.  So cute and comfortable.
"The media could not be loaded.
                




   they are true to size. so comfortable and stylish. beautiful color."
Love them
WE LOVE IT. I bought a toddler size 8 for our 32months old daughter. She absolutely love them! Our favorite part of the shoes is the thoughtful design — one side of the tongue is attached to the lace cage so it’s very easy for our daughter to put them on herself! We are buying another pair!!
These run really small. My grandson wears a size 4 toddler and size 6 was tight and made his feet hurt.
Not for kids with chubby feet!  My son has narrow feet but these would not work for wider feet.  These helped my 15 month old run all over the place!  I felt good about him having nice support.  Great shoe!
"Love these ASICS for our 3 year old daughter.  We’ve been buying these sneakers since she started walking.  Love that they are easy and quick to put on, and the colors match most of her clothes.  Her feet are a little wide, and this brand fits her better than Nike and Adidas sneakers.  She loves that she can put them on by herself now."
"These are comfy shoes that stay well on my kid's feet and are easy for her to put on. The strap seems to have good life in it, but they (obviously, as white shoes) will look new for exactly one day. I would buy them again for daycare shoes, though."
"We started buying ASICS instead of Stride Rite due to some quality issues we had with one or two pairs. This shoe holds up well. When my daughter grew out of it, we sized up and ordered another pair."
Was recommended these shoes because my son is a toe walker. I think it is helping a little but only time will tell. Shoes are great so far!
"Found these sneakers in a list of the best sneakers for the flat feet, thought they have good arch support, but nope... No arch support at all, the sole is absolutely flat(( Maybe it's not the manufacturer's fault of the false advertising, but anyways flat soles are not good for athletic shoes, so 4 stars. Though they look well made."
I’m an ASICS shoe fan myself and these for my toddler did not disappoint. So stinking cute with the baseball design. He wears them almost daily and they’ve held up great! Seriously considering ordering the next size up.
My twins have wide feet and these shoes are perfect for them. This is their 3rd pair.
"I walk 10 km/day, for the las two years I've been using Air Monarch IV, and this  shoes feel more comfortable. Quality is top. And delivery by Purolator was excellent and fast (3 days before expected)."
Great look and feel.This is my second pair.Will buy again great price.
Those shoes make your feet look quite wide. I was not expecting it to be so wide... Regardless the shoe is nice and clean.
tres beau soulier et bon prix
Comfortable
Good quality running shoe
"Die Lieferzeit war zwar etwas lang, aber das Warten hat sich gelohnt. Ein sehr schöner Schuh, passt wie angegossen. Der"
First pair of addias for many many years..will buy addias  again...
Très bon
Just the worst!
I was a little cautious at first. $99 for calfskin leather uppers. Made in Italy so I decided to order a pair. I’m glad I did. Very comfortable with generous arch support. The sole is a proprietary dainite-like sole. The famous rubber studs. It was very grippy and it seems hard wearing which I like.  Now for the leather. It’s not a smooth leather. At first glance I thought it was a waxy suede or a rough out leather. It has a matte like finish. I do like it. It pairs very well with a suit or casual wear. Don’t wear any white socks. There’s some dye issues with the first few wears.
The shoe is of good leather and strong. However the colouring of the shoe is not smart. It looks very odd.Plus the shoes did not have the blue sole but covers black rubber patch. That would make it stronger from friction damage but just mentioning that it wasn’t as presented.I returned for above reason and because the shoe was tight besides saying wide size.
"Shoe looks to be of excellent quality. I normally wear a 11.5 W. Only an 11 or 12 was available, no half sizes. The length fits  perfect but it seems to be a little wider than I expected. Overall it is a great looking shoe."
Yo quisiera la misma bota zai (10) y el mismo color ojo vino favor contestarme para saber di la pido de nuevo
"This is a beautiful shoe, the top of the shoe - is extremely hard leather and cuts into the back of foot.. hard to wear or enjoy, was bleeding after one day on both feet.. this is my second purchase of this shoe… although love the style it’s a waste"
"Excellent, color perfect, fit perfect, thank you!"
Size 13 US wide is slightly small on the 12.5 side. Width is a bit snug at the toes. Pull loop broke on first pull - could be better.
I sent them back as they didn't fit
Nice color. A little overpriced for the quality and workmanship.
Shoes are really worth the price and are comfortable. Real leather.
"Arrived in good condition, within specified time limit. It fits perfectly. Just loving it solo much!!"
"toll verarbeitet, schönes Leder, eine weiche Sohle, also insgesamt bequem - aber leider nichts für kleine Füße. Ich habe 36 und auch so bestellt, doch gehen fast alle Hersteller dem Trend nach, Größen nach oben zu ändern. Wenn dann allerdings von unten - also 35 oder 35,5 nichts nachkommt - sieht es für uns Kleinfüßige sehr schlecht aus. Meist rutscht dann auch noch die Ferse aus dem Schuh, hier gehts gerade noch. Finde ich sehr schade, man müsste ja von diesen 'Größen keine Unmengen produzieren aber sie auch bedienen."
"Zunächst das Positive, das Leder ist tatsächlich angenehm weich, das Tragegefühl ist sehr angenehm, weil der Schuh eine weiche gepolsterte Sohle hat. Das war es dann leider auch schon. Die Verschweißung von Sohle und Leder lässt nach nur 5 Monaten deutlich nach, Feuchtigkeit und Kälte dringen ein. Die Nieten für die Schnürsenkel sind so scharfkantig, dass ich bereits mehrere Paar Schnürsenkel zerschlissen habe. Leider ein Fehlkauf, für 80,- € sollte die Qualität/Haltbarkeit um Längen besser sein."
"Schuhe kamen pünktlich an, wie gewohnt von Amazon.Der Schuh an sich sieht super aus, passt perfekt und riecht nach Leder, was jedoch nicht heißt das er echt Leder ist. Mir fehlt leider der eindeutige Hinweis auf echt Leder, jedoch geben die Kanten am Schuh Hinweis darauf da diese aufgetaut und nicht glatt sind. Eine Anleitung zur Pflege wäre ganz nett gewesen, aber die kann man sich ja im Internet raussuchen ;-)Ansonsten super verarbeitet, nichts steht weg alles sitzt, kleiner heller Fleck an der Seite aber fällt fast nicht auf."
Die Schuhe kamen gut verpackt an. Sind auch relativ bequem- mir etwas zu eng. Aber es ist ja Leder und weitet sich hoffentlich nocht etwas. Auch sind mir die Schürsenkel zu kurz. - Deshalb ein Stern Abzug! Diese könnten bei diesem Schuh etwas länger sind dann wäre es perfekt.
"La piel es muy suave, y están bien acabadas. El color es más bonito que en la foto, es un azul índigo precioso. Calza mas bien holgado, pero en mi caso no para pedir un número menos. Como pega la suela, que es un poco rígida y creo que va a resbalar. Son muy cómodas y espero ponérmelas mucho."
"Tolle Qualität, weiches Leder und super leichte Schuhe. Mit jedem Tragen dehnt sich das Leder, so dass die Schuhe immer bequemer werden"
traumhaft! super bequem! ich laufe auf wolken! war auf der suche nach einem anderen modell der firma... werde nur noch andrea conti kaufen.
Farben sind wie abgebildet. Gute Qualität außer an der Hacke ist eine Verstärkung der Naht. Deshalb einen Stern weniger.
"Quedan muy bien, cómodos y un color vibrante."
"Der Schuh ist angenehm zu tragen, weil das Leder weich und leicht ist. Die Farbe sieht genauso aus wie abgebildet. Die bestellte Größe passt gut."
"Tremenda desilusión ya que al a menos de mes y medio ya se rompieron, pensé que la marca daría la calidad esperada."
"Okay, las compré para mi mamá ya que le gustaron.Ella es del número 4 en talla de mujer así es que tenía dudas sobre el ajuste de la talla 25 que compré. Pensé que sería o muy grande o la forma seria bastante ancha por ser para hombre.La realidad es que le quedaron bastante bien y sí, son un poco grandes pero no se ven de payaso ya que en todo caso, le ayudan a no tener los dedos a ras de la suela, tampoco se ven varoniles.La calidad es buena y el precio es bueno."
"Entrega un poco tardada para ser un producto de esta categoría, mas sin embargo valió la pena.Te puedes balar con ellas o incluso salir a la playa y se ven bien, ya que no son las típicas chancas corrientes o las sandalias de mal gusto pero de moda (CROACS)"
"Están muy anchas, pero además hay una mas ancha que la otra. Y lo peor es que se me pasó la fecha de devolución"
"Pedí la talla de miEsposo y le quedaron muy apretadas. Hubiera pedido un punto más para que entrara las Agusto el pie. Es de pie gordito, talvez un pie flaco no tenga problema. En pie gorro definitivamente no las pueden usar de su talla. Todo lo demás se ve bonito y buena calidad"
"Producto de mala calidad, venía como roto lo sintético de un costado, de ambas sandalias, si pueden no lo compren, no vale la pena"
Las sandalias las compré para mi hijo.Él usa talla muy grande. En esta marca adquirimos talla adecuada y comodidad
"I am giving 4 stars for comfort, though the straps look like its made of plastic. I am a big fan of the colors they have used. Also, it fits beautifully.  So 4 stars from me."
Funciona pero la suela se despinta casi al primer uso y el material del plástico da mal olor
"Súper comodidad y de buena calidad, me quedaron como lo esperaba, el material es ligero y cómodo. El color azul es muy padre. Amplimamente recomendable."
"I PUSHED my husband into looking at these because he likes to walk on snowy days and has a neuropathy issue in his feet and he makes me nervous on snow and icy patches.  Because of artificial hips and some back issues, he also has trouble with tie shoes so these seemed perfect.  I own two pairs  of Merrill’s and LOVE THEM so I really worked to convince him that he should give these a try. HE LOVES THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He loves how they feel, how they look and how they work for him.  These are probably the most expensive shoes he has ever bought but he will tell you worth every penny.  I’m delighted because...well...I was right."
Replaced another pair that wore out after 5 years of heavy useThe soles are not slip resistant like kitchen shoes made with slip resistant soles but my husband uses them anyway due to comfort
"Really liked the shoe - nice construction, looks good, seems well-made.Only problem that it was was narrow and tight even in a size 11 (I normally wear a 10.5).So snug that I could barely get the shoes onto my feet.  Even getting them off was a struggle.Almost too long in length so the next size up would not have solved the problem.For the right feet, these probably will be a nice pair of shoes."
"I bought these to replace a pair of slip-ons I've worn for twenty years and these have become my go-to footwear. They are warm, waterproof, and have provided perfect traction on ice and snow. I'm not a graceful person, so if they're keeping me standing on slick surfaces, then I know they really work. The fit is a little snug, but not uncomfortable at all. If you want a pair of shoes you can slip on and go anywhere in regardless of weather, then these are it."
"I owned a pair of Merrell shoes that I wore for years until they wore out and I bought these as a replacement. They fit great, are extremely comfortable, and look good. I wanted a pair of slip-on shoes that I could wear to the office or on a hike and these succeed in both. They are nice looking leather and look like regular black leather shoes, but they also have specially made high-grip soles which will do well in winter ice. They are very comfortable, look good, and I highly recommend them. I'm very happy with Merrell shoes and when these wear out in ten years I'll probably buy another pair from them."
"I've only had them for a week, however they are comfortable and seem well made.  I like that they are slip-on and quite easy to slip into.  Just yesterday I did encounter some ice on my sidewalk.  I was very pleased with the traction, the ice+ tread does work!  I wear these to the office as well and they are not too hot or cold."
"After a year of wear these still slip on tight with a satisfying ""thuck"".  The heal tops haven't broken down even though I rarely pull them on with my hands - just stuff my feet into them.  Very comfortable, don't wiggle or slip, but aren't tight or binding, great on snow and other infirm surfaces, and great looking with a pair of jeans.  From afternoon walks to bar hopping, these are the first shoes I grab.  I generally wear a 12D even though my feet are a little narrower than that with a high instep, and these fit really well."
"I bought these for my husband - his second pair.  He wore his first pair for about 5 years until they wore out.  A good looking sturdy shoe for walking and working outside.  He says there is no ""breaking in"" period.  He is very loyal to the Merrill brand and believes they are a good value."
"They seem to run true to size when compared with other similar Merrell shoes I've owned. I've owned 3 or 4 pairs of Merrells, and was impressed by each one. Pretty decent grip. I live in a land of ice for 5 months out of the year, and while I wouldn't wear these for extreme excursions, getting around in parking lot or on a sidewalk with patches of ice, these aren't a bad choice."
"I had been looking at this particular color and size show for 18 months. They finally came down a smidge to the price I was looking for. This pair fits perfectly, and the soles of this pair are perfect for winter season coming up. (Well, I live in Phoenix Metro. Before I lived in COS, these would have been perfect.) I do recommend this pair completely, and the vendor was terrific. Product arrived earlier than anticipated."
This shoes is perfect to size
The heel was uncomfortably tight. Just not the Reebok shoe I remember.
"I was looking for a solid black sneaker for my child to wear to private school.  These are comfortable, fit well, are adjustable and reasonably priced."
Normally I love Classics for my kids but this one was only worn for a week when the bottom fell off. ONE WEEK!!!! I was really disappointed.
Nice sneakers and comfortable.  Good for the price.
"My  niece have have one of those since she is in school , she is 7 years old now, so  hers are a little old and small, so i showed her some others of a diferent brand , and she told me: no, buy my the same one, and i reply, but those others are beautifull and pretty, and she  told me; no, mine are more confortable, and pretty. I want the same one. So i purchase it again."

   They said the shoes was made in Vietnam and I received it just now and it shows made in China..  am so disappointed 😞 😪"
When i was young these used to be three best school shoes...now my daughter has a pair
"love them, just what i had expected looks sturdy as they are fir school in septemberWe love them"
Good
"PROOttimo per consegna in anticipo di un giorno rispetto a quella prevista.Modello corretto, taglia corretta.CONTROIl colore delle scarpe è diverso da quello della foto.La scarpa destra presenta rigature sulla pelle esterna ed interna come da foto e non aveva l'inserto per mantenere la forma, sembra sia una scarpa esposta.Non richiederò un reso ma ritengo decisamente preferibile meno solerzia nella consegna e più correttezza nella coerenza con quanto esposto nella foto e nella qualità.Inoltre sullo store Lumberjack il modello con il colore che mi è arrivato è venduto ad un prezzo inferiore."
"Comincio nel descrivere la scarpa, che è di buonissima fattura e il cui unico tallone d'achille è forse la suola, meno confortevole del modello Timberland, che ha un minimo di ""rimbalzo"", ma diciamo che non da fastidio a meno che non ci facciate i km in una sera.Per quanto concerne gli accorgimenti da seguire:- Se non avete già provato la scarpa, scegliete un numero in meno del vostro, calzano larghe, non tanto dalla  punta ma dal tallone, escono proprio. Io porto il 42 e il 41 mi sta bene.- E' una scarpa che va portata dal calzolaio, appena indossata vi accorgerete che non è un cuoio che cede facilmente al vostro piede, e a meno che non vogliate delle vesciche sui mignoli e sui talloni (come successo a me), portatele da un calzolaio e fatele mettere ""in forma"", un paio di giorni.Al ritorno, vi accorgerete di quanto la scarpa calzi meglio, e non soffrirete per nulla.La sto usando spesso, e l'ho acquistata da circa una 20ina di giorni.Acquisto consigliato, ma seguite questi accorgimenti."
"Ho una scarpa identica ma di quattro anni fa, pertanto ho fatto l'ordine abbastanza sicuro che sarebbe andata bene. Questa ha la suola con le stesse misure ma è importabile tanto è stretta. Non capisco se è un difetto ma stando al venditore il modello potrebbe essere stata modificato. Consiglio l'acquisto alle persone che hanno un piede affusolato, poco largo e con un collo stretto. Certamente nella descrizione andrebbe puntualmente segnalata la cosa, ma così non è. Infine il reso NON E' GRATUITO pertanto per quanto mi riguarda MEGLIO ANDARE IN NEGOZIO."
"Nulla da dire sulle scarpe (sono nuove e calzano perfettamente), ma una certa opacita sulla tomaia fa immaginare che non siano appena uscite dalla fabbrica, lucide e splendenti come quelle che si vedono in foto. In più, fra l'una e l'altra ho notaro una leggera decolorazione, come se una scarpa fosse stata esposta alla luce di più dell'altra. Non perfette, quindi, ma comunque senza difetti vistosi che ne pregiudichino l'uso e per il prezzo pagato (52 euro) vanno più che bene"
"le scarpe tipo barca della Lumberjack sono anni che le uso nel periodo estivo per la loro comodità, leggerezza e durabilità."
"Uso lumberjack da anni e mi sono trovato sempre bene,bello il colore e calzano perfettamente io porto la 43.."
Le lumberjeck di questo modello sono veramente sempre di ottima fattura.Complimenti al venditore.43 euro spesi bene.
"Ottimo prodotto, un po' largo, sistemato con soletta. Le dimensioni a mio avviso non rispettano la descrizione della ditta. Arrivato nei tempi giusti."
"Ne avevo già un paio ora consumate, le ho ricomperate perchè ci cammino bene."
Prodotto conforme
"I have almost 100 pair of shoes and these are among some of the ones I only wear occasionally... because they hurt and leave blisters on my feet. I even changed the insoles thinking that might help but, no cigar! If you're the type that wears socks then, maybe these are for you but, I live in Florida and socks are just WAY TOO HOT.... So unless I'm wearing boots, I go barefoot in all my shoes. Now these look good but, fall short in the comfort area. 'Just my two cents..."
"The first walk with these shoes the soles started to crumble off like maybe the rubber was not hardened, or just too soft to be used on a shoe sole.  It was minor at first and I let it go, now 3 months later (I do not wear these every day) there are major sections of the sole completely worn off, and a support wire inside has popped out.I sent pictures and a description to the dockers customer service email and have never heard back."
"Great looking shoe, light weight and was very comfortable after i change out the insoles. The insoles that come with them are not good. Add another 10 bucks to you shoes and they are great."
Took almost 2 weeks for delivery and were a little to large.
Great shoe at a great price!
Pefectos...quiero otros!
Perfect fit. Super lightweight shoes.
Fits well and is very light.
Great fit looks and feels great
"I wear size 9, but these beautiful runners fit more like a size 10 N, so I retrned them, very disappointed!"
"Cole Haan Women's Zerogrand Overtake All Terrain Wr Trail Running Shoe. Normally wear ASICS size 9B. Tried size 9, then 9.5 both were very narrow. Unfortunately I returned both pairs.  I tried the men’s version size  7 and they worked out just fine."
"I love these sneakers!I ordered a half size up because Cole Haan’s sneakers generally runs smallish.But they are comfortable enough for long hikes and all day standing, while being stylish.I’ll buy sneakers more soon!"

   Son hermoso y muy cómodos."
Very comfortable shoes!
"I like the color , quality is good !"
"My daughter was unsure of them at first, she has sensitive feet, I convinced her to give them a go and they are awesome. I read there were sizing issues so I bought to what was recommended but they are just her foot size, and as we were off on holiday could not change for the next size up.I will be getting these again though as I'm told they are very comfortable. 🌟"
"Ottimo prodotto,  l'ideale per il mare e per giocare all'aperto.Garantisce una buona presa sul terreno tenendo il piede fresco."
"Las sandalias son muy cómodas, las usa en casa todo el día luego del colegio, se ajustan muy bien a sus pies."
"My daughter loves these, and she is picky about what she will have on her feet.Thank you!"
Il prodotto è arrivato puntuale anche nel paese dove eravamo in vacanza!Scarpa da bambino molto versatile e leggera! Sicuramente da consigliare.
"Cómodos y prácticos, de calidad."
履きやすく足をしっかりホールドしてくれるので、男子にも安心です。
"I purchased the Wild Dove for my son because it was listed as unisex and the colors looked gray, blue, and orange.  The actual colors are gray, purple, and coral pink.  Hope that helps someone!  Please mark if this review was helpful."
"Very comfortable and well worth the price!  Teva is a very good company. The shoes are very well constructed. My future daughter in-law liked mine so much I bought her a pair as well. She could not get over that they are kids shoes as she and I have small feet and it's hard to find nice shoes in the stores in our size. The caption under the description of these shoes advises to get one size under your actual size, as these run big. And the caption is correct, I could really wear a 4 in these, but  bought a 5 and they are actually a little big and I normally wear size 5.. But I love them !!"
"I like them, and they provide good grip and protection while being airy for my sweaty baby. LOL But there are two problems. They are verrrrry stiff. I cant bend them, without feeling like they might start spiting. I guess that makes them a little tougher? Also, we now have about 5 pairs of the same size shoes for our 17 month old daughter. They all seem to be pretty close aside from these. They are a little big. The issue with is, for the most part they are meant to be worn without socks. The shoes being to big, and being worn without socks will cause the lacing system/tongue to bunch up and hurt.  I would say if you could, order two on amazon wardrobe. One size down and one the regular size your little one wears.Ive never been a good student, so please excuse my poor writing. *thumbs up*"
"Je connaissais déjà la marque en aillant acheté les premières pour ma fille en 2019. Elle en a voulu cette année 2021 c'est le prix qui m'a fait reculé !... Je les avais acheté 22€ en 2019 et maintenant les moins chère sont à 40€... Et les modèles sont pas terrible... Ses préférées étaient à 65, 85€. 😱😱 Pour des petits pieds qui changent de taille tous les 6 mois mon dieu.......Pour au final la peinture s'enlève à certains endroit au bout de quelques sorties... Qu'on perd aussi quelques strass... Non c'est pas sérieux... OK elles sont super canon mais elles ont pas une qualité comme les grandes marques... Je suis tellement déçue !.....C'est possible de les laver à 30 degrés je lai toujours fait avec ses ancienne et aucun problème pour les lumières ça clignotent toujours."
"Belles chaussures pour des petites filles: paillettes, lumières, colorées elles sont fan. Seulement attention, dans d'autres marque ma fille porte du 27 et là je peux bien ajouter 1doigt voir 2 derrière son talon. Elles les aiment tellementqu'on les garde pour l'année prochaine et optons pour d'autres motifs en 26 (il y a du choix!)."
E piaciuto molto
"Au top, comme toujours avec cette marque !Chassures solides, bien finies, originales."
"It fits to size, easy to slip on. If you have a high arch you may have an issue slipping them on"
Loving these shoes! Some have mentioned them being hard to get on but I had no problem. No shoe horn needed. I bought the black Hawaiian print. Ordered my usual size and fit perfectly. Nice cushion inside but of wearing for a lot of walking you definitely want to wear some kind of ankle socks as they rub a bit on the pinkie toe after awhile.  I wore them at a festival for about six hours. No blisters...no pain...just a little rubbing on top of pinkie toe after a few hours. Easy to clean... tossed in wash on cold and air dried... perfect 👌😎
"These run small, I’m usually an 8-8.5, so I ordered 8.5, they are way too small. So order up at least 1 size, I gave them to my daughter who is a size 6. They are cute though."
Mein Sohn liebt diese Schuhe! Fallen kleiner aus.
Va bene
"Scarpa morbidissima.Comprata per utilizzare a lavoro, molto comoda"
"Toller, leichter Schuh"
"Las zapatillas son muy bonitas, como en la foto. Las he tenido que devolver porque tengo los pies anchos y las notaba justas. El largo perfecto."
Passen sehr gut richtig guter Tragekomfort. Sehr guter Preis. Gern immer wieder.
"ARA Schuhe haben etwas besonderes, ich liebe diese Marke. Danke!"
Schuhe  Große 38
"Toller Schuh, sehr bequem!"
Ich habe 5 Paar Halbschuhe von Berkemann - alle in derselben Größe und Passform.Dieser Sneaker ist sehr leicht und ideal für den Sommer aber er ist über eine Daumenbreite länger (nicht breiter) als die vergleichbaren Halbschuhe in identischer Größe. Daher leider zurück.
"Scarpe comode e belle, le consiglio davvero"
Un buen producto con una buena oferta
"Really adorable,although wide.Im a size 6 regular and always a size 6.These are like a 6 1/2 wide so my feet slid out walking.I crochet a smaller insert and glued it in the front because the inside is furry and slippery but they are literally that cute so I had to keep them!I almost sent them back but 6 is the smallest size.That being said,I do love them for all their trouble🙂💕"
"Super cute shoe. I have really high arches and don't know how comfy these will be to walk in, but I like the look. Why no instructions on how to clean, though?"
These are not very comfortable to wear very long - they hurt the tops of my feet.
I get a lot of compliments when I wear them
Super
"I've now purchased 3 pairs of these. They are the most comfortable walking shoes I have found, by far (and I walk about 15-20 miles per day on a treadmill desk). THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU SHOULD KNOW - there are two versions being sold here. One version is ""Made in the USA"", and the other version is made elsewhere. You can easily tell which version you are looking at because the US version says ""Made in the USA"" on both the tung and side of the shoe. The non-USA version is more comfortable, but less durable. Also the USA version runs about 1 size small. I enjoy wearing both about equally. The US version is better for running, the international version is more suited for walking. See pix."
"I absolutely love the look of this shoe and the fact socks don’t need to be worn with them. I returned the normal size I always get since they felt way too big. Went down half a size and they were fairly tight. I stuck with the smaller size since I don’t want to wear socks with them and the hope they’d break in just a little (they have just a bit). This shoe runs slightly narrow in the toe box and no support for running which I assumed before buying. They aren’t as “breathable I thought they would be as well. The biggest issue I’ve had is even just walking my dog in them the insoles constantly would move. I’d have to take off my shoe and adjust it multiple times in just a few miles (I had to glue them down). I really love the look, but if you’re actually moving in them they don’t perform. I prefer Nike flyknit free run shoes if you want sockless shoes you can actually walk in."
"These things looked really comfortable. I got about what I expected, but it was not as good as I thought it would be.the uppers are all an elastic material Nothing hard even above the heel. You slip them on like a slipper. the laces do nothing and are just for show. Elastic pulls your feet tight against the sole. So it is essentially like a slipper with a shoe sole. Unfortunately, that make them kind of hot. It is a little hard to get the shoe on without getting a wrinkle in your sock and that will make your feet hurt after a little while. The thing I like least about the shoe is that it feels and sounds like you are walking in galoshes. they flap a little when you walk.They are not terrible and they look good. I will wear them until they wear out, but I will not buy another pair."
"I've never owned a pair of shoes quite like these before, so maybe it's on me for not going in with the right expectations, but I fine that these shoes are not suitable to be your everyday shoe. The woven ""sock like"" nature is comfortable for short periods but after a few months of wearing them every day, I've found that the lack of support they give your feet actually leaves them feeling more sore than a normal shoe, and my knees have started hurting. I think these would be great for times when you're not in them for very long, but I wouldn't recommend them if you're looking for a shoe to wear for 10hours a day"
I have one word to say wow. I am a huge New balance fan and I love their shoes for years. I thought it would give this style a chance and man am I happy. They are so comfortable so soft. I just can't say enough good things about them. So I'm stocked up for the future I bought another five pairs. reason about so many sometimes on Amazon or other places you buy shoe and you love it and then five months or six months later down the road you want to buy that same pair and you can't find it. So what I've been doing the past year so is just buying multiple pairs so I don't run out. They're extremely sharp looking with jeans and shorts. They look sharp for casual and work.I am so pleased with these shoes these got to buy far be the best new balance in the most comfortable and extremely good-looking shoe. When you first put them on you're like wow I said these are amazing and they are get them and you won't be disappointed.
Just a smidge too big but may be doable w socks. It sucks cause I wanted to go sockless w these. I'm going to consider keeping them for the look and price. Dang... I'm already returning my other NB I just ordered from here same issue. Cool shoes but you may want to go 1 1/2 down if you have a more narrow foot. Update: Returning them. They are big and provide no protection for the toesies. All I feel is my big toe nail poking thru the shoe. I'll be better off wearing house shoes to the gym.
Shoes feel great as expected from the fresh foam technology. First shoe I have had with truly sock fit structure so take a little getting used to. If your feet are a bit smaller or don’t fill out the structure  they will lose some of that tightening them up with the laces but feels good and if you like a looser less structured shoe they are great! Look great and very stylish IMO.
These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever put on my feet. It’s unbelievable. You feel like you don’t have on shoes but little clouds.
"So far so good, I have put just over 20 road miles on these shoes in the first three days and the shoes are comfortable, plush, and forming to my feet. The shoes seem durable but I don’t know yet. With such a soft sock like upper, I was concerned they wouldn’t have support but they do. The upper is really comfortable.One small negative, the front tongue is high and started to uncomfortably rub the front of my ankles but easily solved by folding the tongue over (stayed folded on a 7 miler) or with taller socks."
Super cute.  Warm.  Fit like Skechers runners. True to size.Cat approved!
Para mí gusto son pesados
I have to wear more shoes with ankle support and these do really good I had thought they would be way heavy on me feet but no they feel good they have enough room for your tooties to say oh wow I can relax out finally so yes I give these awesome shoe boots a 5***** thank you sketchers and thank you Amazon God's Blessing to all Stay Safe ....
Love these sneakers! They fit perfectly and have received many compliments!  So comfortable and warm - I have leather boots I can no longer wear because they are too heavy for me to walk in so these are perfect! (I use a walker is why leather boots are too heavy for me.) You will love them!
"I would say can't wait for winter to wear em', but NAH! I enjoy the summer. But I will say that are comfy inside, flexible sole and seem warm. I'm happy I purchased them. To me they are true to size as well."
Super cute and are comfortable
very cozy. lots of complements
"Bei diesen Schuhen ist schon beim ersten Tragen der Stoff vorne an der Schuhspitze am Übergang zur Sohle gerissen, nach zweimal weiterem Tragen auch an anderen Stellen.Mein Sohn  hat sich einfach nur normal damit fortbewegt !Dafür das es Markenschuhe sind sehr ärgerlich.Sind dies überhaupt Originalschuhe?Kann ich mir nicht vorstellen."
Optisch ein sehr schöner Kinderschuh. Tochter hat sehr schmalen Fuß und trotzdem ist der Schuh bei den Gummibändern sehr eng. Stoff ist vorne beim 5ten Mal tragen (Freizeitschuh/kein Gartenschuh) gerissen. Sehr schade.
Wir haben die Schuhe in vielen Größen und verschiedene Farben und sindsehr zufrieden. Dem Kind gefallen sie und er kann super damit laufen.
"Schlechte Qualität, hatte schon nach einer Woche vorne ein Loch im Stoff. Jetzt nach einem Sommer ist die Sohle schon sehr abgelaufen und eigentlich können sie direkt in den Müll. Ich hatte von Puma eigentlich mehr erwartet"
Zapatilla de niña muy bonita pero la tela del frente es fina y no se su resistencia... Delicada para niñas de 3-4 años.
"Mein Sohn trägt sehr gerne Puma Sportschuhe in verschiedenen Ausführungen seit Jahren. Diese Sportschuhe sind leider mit Abstand die Schuhe, die nur nach 2mal tragen ein Loch an der Spitze hatten. Ich denke ein Schuh in dieser Preiskategorie sollte schon bisschen länger halten.Die 2 Sterne gibt es für's Aussehen und die Elastizität."
"Sono arrivati in anticipo, già li porta mio figlio da un po’ di giorni sembra un buon prodotto"
Tolle sehr leichte Schuhe die gut gedämpft sind. Über die Haltbarkeit kann ich noch nicht viel sagen. Auf jeden Fall wirkt dieses Produkt sehr wertig und unserem 4 jährigen haben sie auf Anhieb sehr gefallen.
"Bonitas y cómodas,  buena calidad."
Schön und schicker Schuh
"Eigentlich mag ich Socken von nur die. Aber diese sind nichts. Ultra dünn mit noch dünneren Stellen, die einem dann als Belüftung verkauft werden. Ich halte es eher für eine Sollbruchstelle. Auch sind die Socken sehr rutschig. Man rutscht im Schuh, der bei mehreren anderen Marken Socken gut sitzt, wie verrückt herum. Nervig. Gut dass ich nur ein Paar zum probieren bestellt habe."
I like Nur Die socks because they are made of bambus which make them super airy. Perfect for summer! They are indeed little bit smaller if you consider sizes and there is no big dofference between sizes 35-38 and 39-42 but I would say if you are up to size 37 order smaller one and if you are 38-40 order bigger one. Over 40 it won't fit well.
"Obwohl die Socken super dünn sind, sind sie sehr saugfähig und luftdurchlässig. Perfekt für den Sommer."
Die Socken sind unglaublich weich und angenehm zu tragen. Halten auch nach vielen Wäschen ihre Form. Ein Stern Abzug weil jedes Paar in einer Plastiktüte verpackt war. Das ist nun wirklich absolut unnötig und nicht mehr zeitgemäß. Sonst hätte ich 5 Sterne gegeben.
"sehr angenehmes, weiches Material. Man bekommt keine Schwitzfüße, perfekt im Sommer."
"Bought these shoes for my great niece. They fit well and are comfortable. She absolutely loves them. She's a picky little princess, so it's always a gamble getting her clothing or shoes. These shoes, however, she really loves."
My daughter lives these shoes. She jumps in them and loves the lights. Too bad they only light up on one side. They appear lightweight and therefore comfortable. Happy with my purchase.
We got these as a cheap daycare shoe but they are amazing quality. I expected the little “diamonds” to fall off easily or the lights to stop working (she’s rough on shoes at daycare) but they are all still in tact & lights still work perfectly. I think we will get a lot of life out of these & I will absolutely buy the next size up when it’s time!
"My daughter loves her light up shoes. They're definitely light weight and so far they haven't come apart. If they continue to hold up, they were definitely worth every penny paid!"
The bottoms are slippery which was disappointing.  My little kiddo kept slipping with them on.
These were for my granddaughter who loves them!
Though my daughter loved these but was disappointed that it doesn't light up in one shoe.. I will have to return these.
"Easy on, easy off, very comfortable."
Comfy to kid feet
"I bought these for my son to grow into but my daughter liked them so much she wanted them for herself. These are so very cute and I would say unisex because of the preppy tennis shoe look. My daughter likes to pair them with denim and something pink and it's a great combo of tomboy and girly-girl. The material is thick, the sole is sturdy, and the stitching is clean. Very good quality shoe at an excellent price. I am ordering another pair for my son!"
"Fit as expected, but my son has worn them 3 times and the inside is coming up already. I was able to glue it back down but kinda sucks to have to do that to a brand new pair of shoes."
Son loves them
my boy loves them. they fit perfectly.
No additional comments
Fine
Me quedo perfectamente muy bien era lo que esperaba
"Los zapatos de excelente calidad, recomendados al 100%, lo malo fue que le quedaron grandes a mi novio, era un regalo, es su número 29, pero Le quedaron grande. Traten de pedir una talla menos, por ejemplo mi novio es 29, un 28.5 Le hubiera quedado mejor! Suerte!"
Me gusto mucho  justo como esperaba
"Calidad genial, excelente"
Están súper padrísimos y muy cómodos.
Muy comodos
me encanto
Todo perfecto
"They look good and ok material quality. If you want to wear them for sitting at your desk they are fine but they provide zero support and although fitting snug, the material is so weak that your feet are flying left and right. It’s feeling dangerous at many points. I twisted my ankle first time running with them when making a change in direction. I find them dangerous and won’t wear them for work out."
So I've never spwnt more then 25.00 on a pair of shoes and ive always just bought shoes from walmart i can honestly say thisbwas worth the money and i will never by a pair of shoes from walmart

   Ho acquistato queste scarpe per il mio bimbo. La qualità è Geox: scarpe robuste, leggere, traspiranti e prodotte con materiali di qualità. Il piede non suda e le chiusure con il velcro tengono e sono solide. La suola è flessibile e ti rendi conto immediatamente che è comoda e di pelle! Anche dopo aver indossato le scarpe per qualche ora, non ho notato segni rossi sui piedini.Il design è prettamente sportivo,carino e si presta ad un uso quotidiano. Il colore è strepitoso, blu e rosso...a mio avviso sono più belle viste dal vivo!!!E poi vogliamo parlare delle luci LED? Il mio bimbo quando le ha viste è impazzito di gioia e ora vuole mettere solo queste scarpe! Comodissimo il tasto on/off per le occasioni più ""sobrie"".Sono molto carine indossate con jeans e felpa, ma anche con dei più pratici joggers. Peraltro le ho prese in promozione e quindi le ho pagate poco rispetto ai prezzi esposti nei negozi monomarca.La taglia corrisponde a quella delle scarpe abituali del bimbo.Consigliatissime per tutte quelle occasioni in cui occorre praticità.Ottimo anche il rapporto qualità prezzo.5 stelle meritate e riacquisto futuro delle Geox garantito!Dai un'occhiata alle foto e al breve video che allego così da farti meglio un'idea sul prodotto.Spero di esserti stata d'aiuto nella tua scelta e se così fosse, fammelo sapere 👇!"
"Piaciute moltissimo per la forma e il colore, speriamo durino anche nel tempo"
TUTTO OK
era come  descritto
"An der Schuhspitze löst sich bereits die Schuhnaht, Schuh ist gerade mal 2.5 Monate alt, ansonsten wäre es ein toller Freizeitschuh gewesen."
Chaussures au top . Confortables et lumières clignotantes au moindre pas dès que l'on actionne cette option en appuyant sur le bouton.Bien toutes les saisons mais à voir pour l'hiver...
Passt haargenau und ist hervorragend beim Gehen und Laufen.Macht den Füssen nicht weh.Optimaler Schuh
"Produit bien adapté. Jamais déçue avec ces geox là. De plus elles sont lumineuses. L'avantage c'est qu'on peut éteindre les lumières car bouton marche/arrêt sur le côté de la chaussure. Pour les enfants transpirant beaucoup des pieds les geox sont géniales et cette semelle est, de mon point de vue, plus résistante que les autres."
Bien pour l été car respirante mais pas très solide notamment sur le devant qui se décolle
Super comodissime.
"I’ve owned at least 15 pair of Allen Edmonds shoes over the years, so I was particularly disappointed with these. The fit with my usual size (11.5 EEE) was uncomfortably tight (length and width) and the leather seemed thin and far from what I’ve come to expect. I returned them immediately."
"Nice quality AE shoes. They’re not made in the US, but I knew that when I bought them. They look very good."
"Very good, I'm using them in mowing a steep hill and they do a plenty good job of giving me the necessary grip. They look fantastic and seem to be made out of excellent materials.I have 2 issues with these:First, the wide width size is not quite wide... They feel standard width and that is thought on my feet and makes them a little uncomfortable to wear for a very prolonged period.Second, the heel is a bit low and very stiff, so at one point it slid off and back on just a little and cut my heel pretty bad.If you are fine with the low tops or use thick socks, and if you don't have especially wide feet, I highly recommend these shoes."
"New Balanxe is the best bar none. My sons a high school pitcher. We bought Nike’s and realized his mechanics were off. Turned out his ankles were rolling in on the Nike’s (he’s got flat feet). So we went back to tried and trie NB. For perfect, excellent support all around, and the only baseball clear that does a true wide. Double bonus: they like so cool and the price point was insane. 1/3 the price of the Nike’s. Highly Recomended."
My son loves these! He said they are comfortable to run in and fits perfect!
It’s a little tighter than expected I’d go a half size up
Goof shoe.. very comfortable
These flats are really comfortable for my wide feet. I ordered a regular 9.5 since the wide wasn't available. These don't squish my toes unlike other shoes. I can wear it with thick socks. I would have tried 9W but it wasn't available and the 9.5 works well as the toe box is wide.
"Daughter is 12 years old and decide to try tap. Bought these for reason of cost and uncertainties of her likening tap. These shoes have held up extremely well to much abuse, from tap, shoes remain looking like new. They fit her feet well. She has zero complaints."
"The shoes are great. Deep enough for my inserts.  The Velcro closure is very easy to put on or take off. I am wearing them constantly,Being elderly, they will make a difference, as I had a fall recently.MOui"
"Are you kidding me? I wear a 9, but I ordered a 10 and they are still 2 sizes too small. There is actually a ""41"" sticker on the bottom. I'd say that the 10 is equivalent to a size 7."
"Los compre para un adulto mayor, no resbalan, son comodos y suaves"
"I normally wear a size 7 womens.  I ordered size 7 1/2.  The shoes arrived with stickers on the soles stating that they are size ""38"".  Size 38 in Europe is the equivalent of a size 8 here, so they should have been large for me.  Instead, they are so small I cannot even squeeze my feet into them. I will be returning them tomorrow."
Son súper cómodos y fáciles de limpiar sólo que vienen un poco grandes.
I normally wear a 9.5 but ordered a 10. These were so small there was no way my foot would even come close to squeezing in.
very comfortable  - soft letter!!  will buy other pair later!!
Really nice
"Es ist bereits mein zweites Paar Kong Derbys. Das erste war aus Glattleder, und leider ist diese an der Spitze nicht sehr haltbar und auch bein normaler Nutzung sahen die früh schäbbig aus.Das Problem hat diese Variante nicht, sie sehen trotzdem gut aus und nicht übertrieben nach Wanderschuhen oder so.Nur an den Sohlen dürfte Think! noch nachbessern. Ich sag nur: Schotterparkplatz. Für mich müsste Think! zu diesen Schuhen eine Hufkratzer dazulegen."
"I needed shoes that were comfortable, had arch support, fit my difficult feet, and looked nice and professional for work. I'm young and a lot of shoes that fit the bill aren't cute, but these look good and as a bonus they work great with socks (especially fun ones that poke through the cut outs.) I walk several miles a day in them, and they were comfortable from day one. I find myself reaching for them everyday when picking out what to wear. This is the first pair of shoes I've found that I can't find a single complaint with- I've already picked out the next pair of Propet shoes I'm going to buy."
My Granddaughter loves them.
"Ich liebe diese Schuhe. Sie schmiegen sich an den Fuss an und laufen wie von selbst. Gewohnt hervorragend gearbeitet und aus den besten Materialien. Da lohnt sich jeder Cent den man dafür ausgegeben hat. Dazu langlebig, keine Wegwerfware sondern haltbar ohne Ende. Ich habe schon seit 10 Jahren ein Paar das immer noch nicht ausgetreten ist obwohl ich sie regelmäßig trage. Also auf jeden Fall empfehlenswert."
These Propet shoes are comfortable. I ordered a 10 narrow.  I normally wear a 10 but measure a AAA rather than a AA so I knew these shoes might be a bit wide. They fit well with heavier socks. I can add an insole and wear them with tights or light socks. They do not have as thick cushioning or as much arch support as SAS Roamers but for one third the price they are good and comfortable shoes. They do not have a deep toe box. That doesn't bother me but it might be an issue for some.
Sizes are a little small. My daughter just started fitting in size 1 and the size one was too small
"Ich wollte einen nachhaltigen Schuh kaufen. Ob Think wirklich nachhaltig ist, also in Arbeitsbedingungen, Materialien sowie Herstellungsverfahren kann ich nicht definitiv sagen. Der Schuh ist schön, nach einem Tag Einlaufzeit sitzt er top. Wie es mit der Langlebigkeit ist, werde ich sehen. Derzeit top"
"Purchased for my mother, who needs good support.  She has the other style propet’, Mary Jane, and really likes them.  Took a chance on a slightly different style and she loves them.  They fit true to size, stay on with no heel slipping, good traction on bare floors.  The shoe does not rub or cut the foot as some new shoes may.  Very comfortable from the start.  Definitely recommend!"
They irritate my daughters back ankle a little but are otherwise wonderful.
Vor über 20 Jahren habe ich meinen ersten Think! gekauft und dann immer mal wieder. Noch heute ist er qualitativ sehr gut und das Design ist klasse. Ich bin jedenfalls begeistert.
Love my Propet shoes! I recently purchased this style for fall/winter.The material is a suede-like brushed leather upper. Soft and pretty in black.The insole is very cushiony!I wore them to the grocery yesterday just to try them out. They are much too snug across the top of my feet.  When I took them off my feet were swollen.  I'm keeping them in hopes they will stretch out a bit.8w
"Perfect tap shoes, daughter loved the clasp, easy to take on and off"
Super bequem. Ich trage die nur noch. In anderen Schuhen fühle ich mich eingeengt.
I have bought the biggest size available and it just about fits my son.. I would have loved to buy one size bigger. These kind of sandals are not found so often. I would have loved if they made these sandals for all foot sizes
"These shoes are very comfortable. I am a greeter at church and they are super comfortable. I have Neuropathy, Fibromyalgia and Arthritis, so I need good and comfortable shoes."
Not great for kids with wide feet
Passt einfach ohne vorher anprobiert zu haben. Perfekt verarbeitet.
"Mi hijo es 20.5 y pedi 21 , le quedo muy comodo. Vienen amplios del dorso,. Solo me enviaron color gris y pedi color el verde"
"Meine Groß ist normalweise 46 , aber es ist klein mit diese Shuhe.Möchte gerne 46,5 .Was soll ich machen ?"
My son likes the bright color. Its comfortable and light weight.
GUte Qualität
Superbe paire de chaussures.. exactement le model en photo... magnifique !!!
Damaged products received 2 times... disappointed with quality of Skechers... First time quality related issue in Skechers
"super Schuh,weiches Leder und passt genau!"
"Achetées pour mon fils, pour remplacer ses précédentes chaussures. Je ne suis pas un grand fan des achats de vêtements sur internet, mais là, c'est impeccable et la qualité REDSKINS."
Me encantaron y a mi niña mas !!!! Están hermosos
King kong ist super
"Chaussures portées une 20aine de fois, les semelles se décollent... Les coutures donnent des signes de faiblesse!Passez votre chemin!"
Love the shoes
Très belles chaussures
"These are terrible. I can’t believe they’re actually Skechers. I have worn many Skechers shoes of different types over the years, and have bought many different kinds for my girls. These are the first pair I’ve ever felt that have super uncomfortable interiors. They’re water shoes, so they’re meant to be worn without socks, yet the inside seam where the fabric backing is stitched to the main part of the shoe is so scratchy! My girls each tried on a pair and both were exactly the same inside, so I am returning both. We’ll be going with Speedo brand water shoes this year."
"These shoes were really cute on, and the neoprene back made them easier to get on and off than the classic style. I thought it would make it comfortable as well, however the neoprene is sewn into the shoe with a rather large sharp seam at the ankle. I ordered these for 2 children and both complained of the sharpness and had red marks within 2 minute of walking around the house. Sad because they were great in theory."
"The shoes are nice, but they don't have the proper size chart loaded on this Amazon page.  These ""little kids"" shoes say age 4-8. My soon to be 4 years old son wears a size 9 toddler shoe, so I thought since the size 6 was on sale, I would get it for him to grow into later.  Turns out its the same as a toddler size 6 shoe. Why don't they say age 0-4 toddler then?  And the big kid size must really be for little kids 4-8?Shoes are great, just need a better description and size chart.  Hope this helps any other mom wondering the same :)"
I so wanted to love these. First off they are so pretty. The gold and pale pink combo looked great in person. I wanted a shoe my little one could slip on without assistance from me or having to sit down to put them on. Unfortunately these were not it. The neoprene back has almost no give so to put  on required sitting down and even then she struggled to get these on herself. I told her she could also wear them as a slip on and step on the neoprene backing but she complained that it felt uncomfortable under her foot. That was a feature I thought she would love to get out the door even quicker but again this was not the case. If the backing had more stretch it could be the perfect slip on water friendly shoe.  We'll be sticking to Natives and Crocs for our go to summer shoes. I was so bummed these didn't work out for us.
"Sie sind anders,  als abgebildet. Vorne nur Stoff!"
Shoe packaging is nice the shoe looks just as pictured if not better. The only con is i hste shoes that have shoe laces more for decorations then actual shoe lace needs. This shoe has just that shoe laces that serve no purpose really. They are like slide in sneakers.
I’m a huge fan of this brand. The shoes always fit and never leave blisters. Great quality!
Super cute. My daughter loves them. They fit pretty true to size.
My daughter loved them. I bought a .5 size bigger she said they fit awesome.
Thumbs up.
Cute and comfortable.
So far so good
fit so good and  the color is great fits comfty
First pair of theses but i like them
The product is not sold as advertise. It is too hard on the foot and feels more plastic then rubber
I like them
"Love these flip flops! I owned a pair similar to these and they were just worn out, so I took a chance and ordered some from Amazon. I was very pleased that they fit as expected and are very comfortable!"
There is substantial support for a flip flop with good wide straps that are desired
"A little squeaky at first and takes a few days to wear that squeak out as the foot molds the foam. Hubby loves the comfort and style, and I love the price!"
Wore them for my beach wedding. Comfortable and fit well. I am going to buy another pair.
My husband loves these. This is the first time I have been able to get him to not always wear his tennis shoes. Slip on and go. So perfect for him... and he loves the look.
"These seemed like very nice flip flops. Sadly, I am a 13 shoe and the 12/13 are a little too small for me."
"Some people would consider this a ""tight fit"" but to me it is very comfortable and secure. I purchased 2 more pairs after I received my first ones in the mail."
"Nice, attractive flip flops but the size 12/13 does not fit my husband's size 13 foot."
"Meine Fußlänge beträgt 27cm und ich habe 42,5 bestellt. Nunja.. wenn man breitere Füße hat würde ich zur 43 greifen und werde auch diese nachbestellen. Die Verarbeitung ist super und die Schuhe sind leicht. Ich habe auf anderen Seiten gelesen das diese groß ausfallen sollen und habe leider dementsprechen eine halbe Nummer kleiner bestellt."
"Yo pedi talla 20 mx y llego una totalmente diferente, es mas el producto que se ve en la imagen tiene agujeta y el que a mi me llego trae velcro"
Excelente me apoye en la tabla de tamaños de Amazon y quedaron más que bien.!
El diseño y la calidad de New Balance.Son cómodos fáciles de poner y quitar.
Los tenis esta muy chicos yo quiero cambiar los tenis quería un número 21 de México y según yo decía así en los que peci
La caja llegó muy dañada.
Excelente le gustaron mucho a mi hija
I got these after reading up on the best shoes for toddlers with pronation. My toddler loves them and his ankles and arches look more supported in these than in the majority of his other shoes. They are a little more expensive than the typical stride rite shoes that I have gotten in the past but these have a lot of support and seem to be plenty comfortable for my active toddler.
"I chose these shoes specifically because I wanted laced shoes for my toddler. A pair of laced shoes is shown in the photo; however, I received a pair of Velcro shoes in the same color/design. So perhaps, if you order a size 8W, like I did, you may end up with Velcro shoes, so just be prepared."
"Too small, had to return. It also doesn’t look like very good craftsmanship inn the show itself."
"Shoes look good, but I don’t understand why would you send Velcro when picture clearly shows laces! I can’t be bothered to send them back especially since I know they won’t be replacing them with the correct shoes. I wish I had seen the other reviews."
The rim of the heal area rubs at the back of the ankle.
It is comfortable. Send it to my dad. He loves it. I like the color.
Not comfortable at all.
is ok
"J'ai d'abord acheté ce produit en fonction des cm du pieds de ma 14,5 cm soit 26 de pointure sur le tableau, et j'ai du faire un échange car les chaussons faisaient presque 20 cm de long !Échangés donc avec une pointure 22 et les chaussons allaient parfaitement.Ils sont super jolies et douillets, seul bémol il manque une languette a l'arrière pour faciliter l'enfilage (mon mari n'a jamais réussi à les mettre sur ma fille). Je pense qu'avec un pied plus fort impossible a mettre."
Lo non le ho più acquistate
Die Qualität ist nicht so gut
Très belle légère taille bien rien a dire
"Excelente artículo, solo el color no me terminó por agradar, de ahí en fuera todo está muy bien."
Están muy bonitos y de buena calidad solo que me enviaron 6.5 en vez de 5.5 pero aún así se les dará uso aquí
Muy bien llego a tiempo la calidad muy bienn!
Comodos ligeros excelente calidad
"*If your child has high arches and high bridge, go with the WIDE width instead of the Medium width. The elastic band under the shoe laces will be too small for a high bridge foot and cause discomfort. Go WIDE! It’s a beautiful light weight shoe and my 9yr old really enjoys they way they feel. He especially like the heel cup as it rides slightly high with a large tab that he can get a good hold of as he slips them on and off. We will be ordering more pairs in different colors."
"Perfect sneaker for active kids! They are lightweight and easy for my kids to put on. Not knowing how to tie, these laces stay tied longer (considering the rope type lace) and the boys can just slide them right one. The back is more of a rubber material which helps allow room for the heal to easily slide in.  Having two 5 year old twins, these shoes being simple to put on saves me time on busy school mornings.  They have worn them since March pretty much every day through a bike riding, hiking, the park and riding their scooters.  They hold up very well."
"I bought these in July for my daughter to start school in August of 2021. We love the shoes in general, we owned the gray last year with no problems. However, i bought the navy this year and they broke not even 3 weeks in. I fixed with a thread/needle. now fast forward to today 10.22.21. They broke again and are unraveling. I am not satisfied with how they are made. Other than that it is a good shoe, but the eyelets where the strings go through are not sturdy at all. I bought for a girl, so i can about imagine a boy may be even harder on the shoe."
I ordered a big kids 6.5 which in most shoes fits perfect. These are a little big. So order true size. Other that that don't not rip tag off of strings this will cause the lace loop to break. Pretty decent shoes
"Loved the fit and color of this sneaker.  However, less than a week out of the box and normal wear, the side of the shoe ripped.  Really surprised that that happened."
"Shoe lace eyelet broke, sent back and got another pair. Next day broke in same spot. Don’t buy.  Then charges a $10.51 restocking fee!  Ridiculous!  Even after I tried to try a second pair."
"These are very comfy and cute sneakers.  My foot tends to be average to narrow width so if you have a wide foot, you might have a problem."
I love the color! Looks like it costs twice the price. Naturalizer has always been a favorite of mine and this shoe is again a hit.
"Item not as described - not real leather, all man made which led to squeaking and sore heels. Very disappointed- too late to return."
I needed these for physical therapy & I’m very satisfied. I usually wear a 7.5M & I bought a 7W & they are fine!
Son muy lindos pero la calidad no es buena. Apenas tenían dos dias de uso y se descosturo la lengüeta.
"cute, but not real leather"
"Au départ assez dures comme toutes les dr. Martens, elles font un peu souffrir. Mais c’est aussi le gage de leur résistance ....Prévoir des grosses chaussettes et des pansements, au bout d’une semaine elles sont adaptées à votre pied, ne font plus mal et vous durerons toute la vie!"
"Very disappointed! It was advertised as leather, but this is a plastic shoe!The shape did not seem right either, I own several pairs of docs, and those just don’t seem right."
"El calzado es bueno, la amortiguación boost se siente en plenitud, si tienes el pie amplio lo puedes sentir ajustado.  En mi caso en la parte de los dedos, sentí que la ""altura"" del tenis es un poco reducida y mi dedo gordo se asoma sobre el tejido.  No me agradaron los cojinetes de la zona del talón, no dan un soporte adecuado y en ocasiones sientes que el pie puede salir.  Rescato la amortiguación boost y el agarra sobre cualquier tipo de suelo."
"This is the first pair of Adidas basketball shoes i have owned and so far I am impressed. The boost soles add a noticeable amount of cushion and the toe shape is wide which is perfect for me feet. I often have a problem with my toes being too cramped in basketball shoes causing my toenails to break all the time. So far I haven't had that problem with these. There is also pronounced cushion ridges in the lining at the heel which keeps your feet planted inside the shoe which is a must for balling in low tops. So far I am impressed, I just hope they hold up to wear and tear."
"These shoes are way wider than they look. Felt like I was wearing swim flippers. If you only wear these in doors you don't have to worry, but if you wear them outside be prepared to pick up every single small pebble on the ground you ever step on. Despite being wide, they look was still cool and they fit a little tight. With my regular size."
"Do not wear these for indoor basketball. They slip and slide all over the place. Good for looks only, not function."
"To begin, I'll say I don't ever expect a running shoe in a basketball shoe, but I did expect an added layer of comfort with what appeared as a substantial amount of boost foam. In short, it's still a quality shoe, but if you're expecting ultra boost comfort, keep looking. It's still a basketball shoe and it will still feel as such on your feet."
This is a awesome good looking pair of shoes.
"The shoe fits as expected, and they are comfortable except that the tongue is to thin at the top and when i tighten my shoelaces they cause pain where the the tongue doesn't protect right above the foot."
I don't have big feet by any measure but I found these shoes to be far too tight squishing my feet despite me ordering one size larger than my actual size. I tried wearing them once and they gave me such cramps I had to return them.
"These shoes were super tight when I first put them on, then after walking around inside for a few hours they loosened up and became very comfortable. I got these for dodgeball, but they just look too clumpy and big and it just wast my style and the look just wasn't doing it for me."
"Cuando los desenpaque los senti algo pesados, pero ya puestos son bastantes livianos. Pedí los de talla 12 pero recomendaría pedir un talla y media más, ya que los siento un poco apretados en lo ancho, de largo quedan perfectos"
"Super bequem das Leder, drückt und schneidet nicht ein. Die Sohle ist super flexibel wie die Schuhe von pepino.  Meine Tochter hat einen hohen Spann und die passen supi. Ich habe die Sandalen in schwarz noch bestellt. Kann die Sandalen nur empfehlen. Ich hoffe ich konnte helfen."
"Tolles Material,tolle Verarbeitumg!"
pour la maison au bout d une semaine le talon s est completement use et fendu tres mauvais produit
"OMG, these deerskin moccasins are much nicer than I thought they would be. They are soft deerskin leather inside and out. No fake lining, no rubber sole, nothing but the real deal. Comfort beyond belief. These are for indoor use only; do not expect to wear them outdoors for even a few steps.As far as sizing, they are generously cut as far as the length goes. I typically buy size 11 or 12 shoes, depending upon the brand/style. I bought these in size 11. They fit perfectly even with socks on. So, if you are “on the fence” about two different sizes, I’d recommend going with the smaller of the two sizes that you typically buy in shoes."
"Purchased a pair of black double deer mocs several months ago. Aside from the top panels looking as though they were switched left to right the build quality seemed okay for a few months. Wife told me they were leaving black marks on the damp floor after she'd mop.  So I then purchased a pair of the ""natural"" double deer.  Wore those for a day and noticed a defect in the left insole, like a void in the padding between the two soles.  Sent in a request to Amazon for a replacement.  Returned those and received the replacement a few days later.  This pair has a weird anomaly with the insole of the right moc.  Kicking myself now for returning the first pair before the replacement arrived.  Between the two pairs I could have had one decent pair.  Giving up at this point, will wear them until they fall apart and just pretend that I'm not bothered by the feel of the right one.  Guess my expectations are just too high for a pair of $100 mocs.  I've had Minnetonka mocs most of my adult life and I don't remember ever experiencing these kinds of problems in the past."
"I'm wearing them as I type. I mean I'm NOT typing with moccasin glad tootsies cause that would be silly... and I might pull a hammy. I was given a pair of Minnetonka mocs... many moons ago... and I wore them like forever and a 1/2. Fast forward through the memory archive and I now have another pair. On my feet. Real nice too. Size works for me and I like the little 'sticky' patches you get while walking. You know what I mean. It's those areas where it fits a little tighter and keeps these bad boys secure.Final thoughts where I don't ramble... looks like good quality, stiching looks complete, a little padding in the bottom (something my EX might have said), light weight and no aardvarks were harmed in their production.CheeriooooOOOooooOoooooOOoo..."
"I bought these for use inside my home. I love them and am thinking to buy an extra pair because you never know when they will stop making them! I got my brother a pair as well and he loves them too. I'm into high QUALITY SHOES OF ALL KINDS. I also have a pair of L.L. Bean lined (REAL shearling) with leather and unlined all leather, both are double sole slippers. I love those as well but these are much softer, due to the deer skin construction.These can be worn out side in DRY weather, summer time, used for driving, So you are from the house to car, Car to house. They are NOT for use walking outside all the time you will sear through the soles to quickly!If you want some beautifully made indoors shoes, that can be used in a limited way outside then these are for you. Real leather especially Deer Skin, is something you have to experience to understand and appreciate!You feet do not get nasty inside REAL leather shoes. They do not start to stink, unless you have nasty feet or problems to start with! I had a pair of the L.L. Beans for 30 years! They are VERY WELL MADE! So are these!"
"Expensive, but of the highest quality. I ordered size 9 and returned them for 8 1/2. Which is still long enough that my toes don't hit the end. I wear New Balance walking shoes in 8 1/2, 4E (the only company I know of that makes a shoe in that width). Amazingly, right out of the box these mocs were perfectly wide and had a very comfortable toe box.  I went through no stretching period at all. I must say I hesitated to pay, what, $80? Whatever. Now I wouldn't send them back for twice what I paid. I have only worn them inside. If I don't go out in them on concrete and asphalt, I figure I'll still be wearing them for at least ten years, maybe twenty. (I've even worn them to bed to keep my feet a tad warmer.)"
"I have been telling myself, for a good long time now, that $15 slippers from the superstore were good enough.I have been lying to myself, for too long now, and that lying was going to stop. Pronto.A good long time ago, I sold these moccasins. Simple, smooth, double deerskin soles.It wasn't the simplicity of a cheap slipper that I have wanted. No. What I wanted was the simplicity of these quality Minnetonkas.The lies are over, and a little piece of me that was askew was renewed. What I wanted is what I got, and what I got is worth every penny.I wear a size 11.5 shoe. I bought a size 11 moccasin. You will have no real idea of how your moccasins are going to fit during the first 24 hours of wearing them. If you follow the simple rule of choosing a moccasin one-half size below your normal shoe size, you will be able to see how the leather and stitching are conforming to you foot during that first day's use.If the moccasins are too tight, or too loose, then I have to ask you to reflect on the honesty with which you are reporting your shoe size. Please understand that there is nothing wrong with having size 13EEE feet. Please also understand, it is not Minnetonkas fault if you are trying to put that size 13EEE into a size 11 moccasin, and it doesn't fit or even falls apart. It just isn't.These moccasins have made me free.The leather is supple; the stitching is tight and a good complementary"
"First size I ordered (as per reviews) was what I wear now. When the mocassins came in there was a nick in the leather. The mocassins were way too long. Do I returned for a replacement with the next smaller size. This set came in with one of rhe mocassins defective. Stitching was coming apart. And the mocassin was still too loose. They do feel comfortable to the naked foot. No arch support however. If you need arch support these are not for you, or (like I will, because I still like these) an arch support insert can be added. Hopefully this next time around they will fit.I am very grateful that they take CS seriously and are replacing these without charging me. I know that is expensive, but I ordered as per instructions on the site."
"Old-school deerskin moccasins just like I remember from years ago. Well-made, comfortable and I am guessing they will be very durable, though it's too soon to tell for sure.  With a pair of cozy wool socks they are they perfect footwear for around-the-house fall and winter indoor wear.  The leather soles are thick enough for a quick trip out the mailbox or trash can so long as it is not wet outside. Note that they do run quite large. I ordinarily wear somewhere between a 9.5 and a 10.5 depending on the shoe (with the majority of shoes in my closet being a size 10) and I have a normal-width foot. The size 9 in these fits me quite well."
"Light weight, fit well. I normally wear a USA 9.5 and have a wide foot. Bets fit for shimano shoes seems to be a 44 for my wide feet."
Muy bonitos y de buena calidad. Llegaron súper rápido.
"We received the incorrect size and sent them back to exchange for the correct size. I have sent several items back to Amazon and it has always been a smooth process. As for the shoes, I bought a pare for my 9 year old son who throws shot put and discuss. He has a very flat wide foot and they fit him perfectly without having to get a wide size. You want them to have a snug fit. Like most beginners he started throwing in heavy lugged running shoes and had a difficult time turning his hips. His PR’s have gone up since buying the shoes because he can simply transfer power more effectively. So if you have a beginning thrower these ASICS will boost their throws and confidence. They are also affordable for a younger thrower that will eventually grow and need another pair at some point. ASICS quality is also on point. He has probably 1000 shot put throws and 1000 discus throws over the summer and hardly any wear on the shoe at all!"
"A superior all-purpose throwing shoe for the price.  I only buy ASICS for throwing shoesdue to quality, comfort and durability.  My last pair of ASICS, similar to this pair, but higher end, lasted 7 years and I only retired them due to my shot putter borrowing them and breaking his own school record and placing fifth in the State of Florida 1A.  As is custom upon breaking a record, the shoes were retired after the State of Florida Championship."
I am size 15 in the shoe fit perfectly
Son likes
Product ran very comparable to my sons shoe size.
The shoe it self is as expected. The delivery was way faster than expected. It said expect shipping in a couple of weeks. It got to me in about 6 days. Very happy.
"Great throwing shoe. Great fit, very durable"
"The shoe fits perfectly, it is a great starter throwing shoe, and definitely worth the money."
These Throws shoes fit true to size.
Fällt absolut größengerecht aus. Sehr schönes Leder und tolle Farbe. Super warm und absolut wasserdicht. Wir pflegen sie mit Bienenwachs.
"I know toddlers wear out shoes like crazy but the inner part of the shoe seems always humid and the leather looks terrible after a few weeks. Even with extra protection, the boots look bad."
Very nice boots! Good quality and great comfort my daughter loves them and me too!
Sehr schöne und warme Stiefel. Passen aber nur bei dünnen Waden.
El producto que recibí son dos zapatos para el mismo pie. Pie derecho.Todavía tendré que realizar la devolución y pagar por eso.
These are really nice sturdy shoes but definitely fit on the big side! Ordered a size 8 and got a size 9 fit
Excelente producto
Fällt etwas klein aus:bietet auf dem Hallenboden guten Halt
Got these for my 12 year old after the Nike’s we got her made her slip too much!They have great grip and she said they were comfortable! She’s normal between a 9.5-10 in show and I got her the 9.5 and they were perfect!
"I have other Adidas, size 8 1/2, I got the size 9 which I was expected to fit well but it is really tied. Some reviews suggested getting a smaller size; make me wonder if they are talking about the same shoes. They look great and I am hoping to break them in for better fit."
"My feet measure 9 1/4"" and size 6.5 fits perfectly. A bit stiff at first, but after one afternoon of wearing were perfectly comfortable. The shoe area at the top of ankle (top/rear of shoe) bothered me (dug into ankles) at first, but softened after first use, not a problem at all anymore. These shoes are designed for volleyball, but I use them to play tennis & they are great. Good fit, good traction, well produced. Very comfortable overall & I feel safe making swift moves on tennis court!"
i loved these shoes.my daughter plays volleyball and needed a supported shoe to wear.i would definately  consider these shoe to any volleyball mom.
"Runs small! VERY narrow across the heel and through the top of the foot. Also, super hard inside, the footbed is nice but everything else is really rigid. She said they were almost painful to stand in."
My daughter loves these shoes and she’s a very picky shopper! They fit her great and she wears them proud! Good purchase!
"Currently owe 3 pairs of Toms in brown, blue and Black! Best all around casual to dressy men’s shoes."
"It seemed like a quality product, but unfortunately it is not meant for those with wide or slightly chubby feet!  I should have realized this now that i think back to the original TOMS.  (I even bought a size bigger!)"
El producto lindo lo devolví por tamano
"Per me non esistono altre scarpe da ginnastica , sarò parziale , ma per me è  così...... ne ho un paio vecchissime ...incollatissime usatissime....le guardo e dico ogni volta: meravigliose!"
Modello originale e pianta del piede stretta perfetta per il mio piede!
buone
Regalo per la mia ragazza. Arrivato nei tempi previsti e in buone condizioni
These are adorable. They almost seem to be a light denim fabric. My daughter hasn't worn them yet - hoping for comfort. Do they have these in adult sizes??? Super trendy.
excelente
My son got a hole in the toe of his shoe after only a month of wearing. So disappointed in the quality.
"Bequemer Schuh, nur die Adidas Streifen lösen sich nach paar mal tagen schon ab.Sehr sehr schade…."
300mmの靴を買いました、でも、295mmの靴を届けました
The shoes are high quality but the sizing runs a bit small.
Fit just right.
"Schuhe sehen toll aus und sind gut verarbeitet. Größe habe ich 44 bestellt,bei Sportschuhen habe ich 45,5. Hier aber passt 44 gut."
Für den sehr günstigen Preis bekommt man hier einen bequemen und gut aussehenden Markenschuh. Demnach gibt es nichts auszusetzen
Sehr schöne Optik.Passt zu jeder Hosenfarbe.
Für diesen Preis 25€ mit prime Versand  finde ich okey Qualität gut 👍
They are sized accurately but keep in mind that your kid will be wearing thick soccer socks that can make their foot snug so you may want to go a half size up.
Exactly what we wanted
My son loves his red cleats. The are a bit narrow though.
"My new all-time fave shoes for lifting. I can really feel the difference in my connection with the ground. The first week I wore these, I PRd both my deadlift and my squat. Maybe just my mindset on those days but I do believe the shoes helped. They’re not only perfect for digging into the floor on heavy lifts, but they’re also super cute with shorts, jeans, leggings etc. I love em. I just absolutely love them. Wish I could find my size in some of the other colors because I would definitely add more of these to my “shoe collection.”  Some reviewers stated they’re like “clown shoes” because of the wide toebox- I do not find that to be the case but I do prefer a roomier toebox. Love the low profile (I loath thick soled sneakers). The first few wears I did notice a tightness across the top of the foot where the seam is but my the third time I wore them, they were broken in and are now my “close toed” shoe of choice. I found the fit to be very true to size. Love the color. And LOVE that the laces stay tied throughout my entire workout!"
"I usually wear a 6.5. The other reviews said they ran small so I ordered 2 sizes up. I ordered a 7.5. I could have used an 8. This is so far off that ""runs small"" doesn't capture the issue. My toe is pressed to the end of the toe box and they are 2 sizes larger than ""normal""."
"I am glad I took other reviewers' advice to order half a size up.  Even so, it fits quite narrow but the room in the toe area is just perfect (not too much and not too little).  I wouldn't order a whole size up though so half a size is good.  These will help dig those heels on the ground during squats and deadlifts.  I am a powerlifter and have been looking for these shoes for so long.  Glad I found them now.  I think these are more superior to Converse.  Again, the only reason why I am taking a star off is due to the narrow fitting but I guess that's how the shoes will keep your feet from moving."
"I'm sure I would love this shoe, if it fit! I sized up 1/2 size like everyone suggested, and they are 1/2 size too large :(I am a true 8.5 in all brands, and it seems this shoe is no exception. If you feel you are solidly the same size across brands, I do not recommend sizing up.Also, only order prime! Because the non-prime-but-still-free-shipping company makes you pay for the return shipping and a 15% restocking fee."
"The fit is soooo narrow! I have a wider foot, but even if I didn’t it wouldn’t fit because the seam by the toes fits right on the bone by your big toe and it is extremely painful to just put on. The quality looks good, but I wouldn’t have a clue how they actually work because of the fit. Returned them"
Mom loves these shoes but they will take a little time to break in. They are so cute on!
"A bad experience, the shoe has only been worn for the second time, the sole has fallen off, and the shoe body is too hard!"
"It is very cute , my daughter loves it . Def order 1/2 size larger . I like to order more in diff color"
"Product is great, they run a little bit small, so I suggest ordering a half size larger. Love the sneakers."
Been using this for two years and still grippy! The suede is a bit high in maintenance but the color is great.
"Light weight, great looking and perfect for casual work or play. Didn't require any break in at all. Felt good right out of the box!"
"The boots arrived just as I ordered them, on time and they are very pretty. love it.  And the price, excellent."
Always bought Clark’s unstructured shoes for comfort. 40% cheaper than in store. Great value. You’ll enjoy them.
"Perfect fit and feel right out of the box.  Fit was consistent to size.  Very comfortable, soft sole.  Works well in the office or with more casual attire.  Ordered a second pair in a different color.  Very pleased with the quality and function."
"Stylish, comfortable, and quite versatile. Can't go wrong with Clark's."
Si me quedó muy bien
One of the most comfortable pair of shoes I own.
Love these boots.
nice boots but quite expensive
Loved it
Purple ones rock.  My kid gets compliments wherever we go.
Loved them
"Produit de qualité très Moyenne. La semelle s'use plus rapidement  que d'autres souliers. J'avais eu en gros rabais et même là, je ne rachèterais pas"
"Quedan un poco más grandes, están amplios y súper cómodos y ligeros"
Bought for my 10yr old son. They fit great. He has not complained. Had them a few months and they are still intact.
"My son loved the shoes, they were comfortable and fit well. The shoes laces are held in place by a piece of string and it broke a few days after we received them. I contacted Amazon right away and they instructed me to contact Adidas for a refund/exchange. I submitted my request to Adidas on July 11 as requested by Adidas customer service. When I didn't hear anything after a few weeks I emailed them again. Several emails sent asking about an update went ignored. I had to use the chat feature on the Adidas website to get an answer. I was finally issued a return label and sent the shoes back and they were received on August 26. I followed up with customer service again and I was told I would receive an email update after 5 business days (the time it takes to inspect the item) and then the gift card would be issued within 7 business days. This still has yet to happen. When I contacted customer service again, they now changed their story and said that because I didn't purchase the shoes directly from Adidas I would not receive my gift card until 20 business days after the shoes were received. I am now being told that I won't receive my gift card until September 23, which is 2 1/2 months AFTER I submitted all of the required information to Adidas to start this process. I will not be making any more purchases of Adidas products."
"Bought these for my 10 year old. He likes the sleek look of adidas, but we won't buy these again. Purchased mid-february and by early May, the soles were worn completely through in several places. I don't mind spending more on name brand shoes because the quality usually matches the price, but that's clearly not the case with these shoes. Very disappointed in the Adidas brand. We've had $15 sneakers from Walmart last longer than this. Waste of money."
"These are very comfortable shoes, but my son has gone through 3 pairs since April.  Of course he grows out of them quickly, so I’m replacing them anyway, but every pair has literally been falling apart after only a few months.  It would be nice if they could at least be used for play/yard shoes, but they aren’t even in good enough shape for that.  We are going back to buying Nikes."
"Very nice presentation. The box was in amazing condition.(most of the time, they're all torn apart and damaged) so bravo on that part 👏Sizing was good. My son is a 10/10.5 and these are 11. They fit him with room to grow. They look sharp! Definitely legit. They're made in Indonesia. Usually, that's a sign they're authentic. Very good. One happy mama. I will update maybe in a few months to tell about the wear."
"My son has only worn these for six days and they are literally falling apart. He loves the fit and how light they are, but it’s very disappointing that they look like this after less than a week."
"I needed some running shoes for my son quickly when he told me he signed up for track. Looked a some Nikes that were so soft, they'd shred in no time (as Nikes do), checked out some Under Armor...too clunky and heavy. Found these and they are pretty durable. They have a knitted top and light foam sole perfect for my kid. He's rough on his stuff so these are perfect. These are pretty light for running or just play. I definitely recommend giving this pair a try."
So glad I bought these. My son is the pickiest about his shoes. I let him pick these ones out after refusing the other ones I bought. They came 2 days earlier than expected and once they arrived I realized they don’t have a tongue which is sweet. It’s easier for him to put on but looks and feels like a normal sneaker. I am very happy. Can’t beat $30 for a name brand shoe that appeases my child ☺️
"Comprei uma antes que ficou muito grande (29/30), precisei devolver para pedir um numero menor e ficou perfeita. Escolhemos a verde e achamos muito linda. Meu filho tem 5 anos e adorou."
"O produto não foi entregue nas mãos de alguém. Foi deixado no portão de casa ou jogado não sei como. Só sei que os cachorros morderam e estraçalharam o pacote e o chinelo. Muito chato!! Acho que a entrega deveria ser feita em mãos, não acham?"
"Chinelo é macio e me parece original , chegou antes do prazo e bem embalado . Comprei 33/34 para o meu filho que calça 32 de sapato fechado, e ficou perfeito ."
Ficou lindo no pé do meu filho! Super recomendo.
"Gostei muito do prazo de entrega e o produto é exatamente o que eu comprei e o que esperava do mesmo.Muito obrigada,"
Material da correia bem ruim! Já arrebentou. Vai ter que ser como antes colocar preguinhos na correia para usar chinelo havainas por mais tempo.
"A forma é muito grande. Comprei um número acima do que meu filho estava usando, e estava pequeno, e ficou muito grande. Mas ele amou o chinelo e está usando assim mesmo."
Entrega rápida e produto muito bonito e de qualidade. Atende ao proposto no anúncio. Super indico.
"Chinelo bom, conforme esperado."
Ótima compra com valor acessível e entrega rápida antes da data prevista. Produto igual do anúncio.
"Color, fit, everything great!"
Dieser Sneaker sieht wunderschön aus... sehr bequem...einfach super toll
Süper Qualität..danke.
Super basket
"Arrivate prima del previsto. Sono esteticamente molto belle. Le ho prese per la mia bambina di 11 anni. La taglia corrisponde perfettamente. Ora le proveremo nelle giornate di pioggia nel parco della scuola ma avendo già ripetutamente acquistato scarpe Salomon, sono certa che si dimostreranno comode e impermeabili."
"El calzado es estupendo, de una calidad buenísima, muy resistente, quería coger una talla más para q le quedara un poco grande pero le queda clavado, con lo cual es una talla bastante justa, pero en resumen estamos encantados con la compra!!"
"Ottimo prodotto. Solido, impermeabile, calza bene."
Passt genau und sieht gut aus.
Salomon non smentisce mai
"Sehr leichter Schuh mit Schnellverschluss, die Größe ist ein bisschen knapp bemessen."
"Son comodisimas, el tallaje está bien"
"Prese al prezzo super di 12 euro. Le scarpe sono bellissime, piaceranno a qualsiasi bambino. I materiali sono ottimi, tomaia in similpelle molto morbida e facilissima da pulire con un colpo di spugna, suola dello giusto spessore e che si adatta benissimo al piede, anche lo strappo e tutte le finiture sembrano fatte davvero bene. Più adatte a stagioni invernali e mezze stagioni, meno adatte per l estate. Unico appunto, prendete un mezzo numero in meno, calzano leggermente grandi. Ottime scarpe kappa. Spero di essere stato utile."
Ne ho approfittato che c'era lo sconto e le ho comprate qualche numero più grandi. Il prossimo inverno le userò tantissimo. Le conosco già e sono molto comode.
Die Schuhe passen perfekt und die Qualität ist wirklich Top. Preis Leistung stimmt und Kappa ist generell eine gute Marke.
"Scarpe leggere, piuttosto plasticose, nulla di che, ma mi servivano per far giocare la bimba in giardino. Prime per lo scopo"
Ich habe die Schuhe zweimal bestellt. Einmal für meinen Sohn u Einmal für mich. Sehr zufrieden.
Belle scarpe. Molto bello il contrasto tra blu e rosa fluo. Come la foto. Vestono bene. 5 stelle!
"Ein sehr leichter Schuh, flexible Sohle und sieht auch fein aus."
"Mein Sohn mag ihn sehr gerne tragen! Sein Lieblingsschuh, egal ob Schnee oder Regen!"
Molto belle e di ottima fattura.
I was so excited for these shoes for my son that I disregarded all of the negative reviews. But now I am stuck with the shoe that my son cannot wear because he literally tripped and fell out of the shoes because the strap is too short. I even sewed an extension on the strap to help make it longer and the velcro that is attached to the shoe is very weak. So here I am stuck with very expensive shoes for my 5-year-old that I spent a lot of money on please do not purchase these you will definitely be disappointed.
My kid love it !!
Love these but the strap across the top is so short it comes undone immediately. Very frustrating. Not sure what they were thinking with this. And it isn’t just this one pair. I ordered my daughter the same pair in a different color and size and have the same issue.
"My son loved the shoes, very vibrant color, very good looking, very comfortable. Would be a great shoe if not the design defect in velcro that keeps the shoe attached to the kid :). The receiving part of velcro is just about half an inch in length - there is no way it's enough for a kid who is running around 24/7 - as soon as he starts running the velcro detaches and shoes become useless. I hope Adidas fixes that defect in otherwise wonderful shoe."
"Zapatilla demasiado grande, compré talla 6 big kids, para mi sobrina de 12 años y le quedo enorme al probarlas me ha quedado a mi soy talla en mujer #8 americano, venia en caja original y la calidad del zapato sé vé buena , en conclusión para mi es original pero viene mal marcada o etiquetada o es un sale."
The shoes have gold in them which is not pictured as well as no Velcro. Item is not as described.
Son súper bonitos y de calidad como siempre lo espero de adidas👌🏼🙂
We tried numerous pairs of sneakers and my kid loves this shoes best!
Fits well and easy to snug up without adult help.
"It's nice looking and super comfy, I agree with many reviewers that it misses 1 star as the strap is super short and would cause uncomfortable feeling at the feet uncle"
"Schöner Schuh für heiße Tage. Das Mesh ist oben groß perforiert, so dass die Füße schön belüftet sind.Allerdings hat man keinen starken Halt, dafür sind sie zu instabil. Ansonsten sehr schön und angenehm zu tragen."
"Super Golfschuh für den Sommer, luftig, leicht, sehr angenehm zu tragen"
Se ajustan a lo que buscaba.
Schöner Sommergolfschuh
I use them on the golf course
Sehr leicht und komfortabel!
Zum Golfspielen
Très jolie pour une tenue de golf comme une robe ou jupe.
"I live in Florida and play year-round.  The shoes have held up well through two years of wear.  I'm not too fond of the latest trend of wearing sandals for golf, preferring instead to have my feet shod while playing (never know when you might run into some unfriendly red ant).  And best of all, they clean up nicely.  Just drop them into the washer, and set them on a stand to dry."
I e been wearing this golf shoes for years and love them. We spend our winters in Az where it can be really hot and the mesh is light and airy. My feet don’t feel like they are on fire’
Nearly impossible to get on their feet.  If I get a size that will slide on then they are too loose on the actual foot.  Bizarre design
"These are good, simple indoor shoes. My son wears them on the court and sand turf and has no problems with them."
My son loves his indoor shoe
My performance increased. Scorning more goals than ever
This indoor shoe is a good buy and has held of great for this winter season.
"Exelentes, muy cómodos, el pie respira atravez del material, los compre coml un regalo para mi esposa y le encantaron, al principio pensamos que el material se aflojaria con el uso diario pero por el contrario es muy resistente y no se deforma"
"love that Skechers offer so many stylish sneakers and shoes in wide width.  these are so comfortable, like wearing ankle socks with a sole.  the toe box is super roomy, and I think it would be roomy even in regular/medium width.  the fabric of the shoe allows for even more toe movement, good for me because I don't like constricting footwear.  for knockabout, running-errands footwear, you won't find anything much more comfortable than this, hence the 5-star rating.  for serious walking or standing, though, these will be lacking in arch support.  and I'd make sure to stay on flat, even terrain because the fabric doesn't provide much structure.  I could see stepping wrong and someone's foot sliding right off the sole, easily causing a twisted ankle or fall.  but for what they're meant for, they're awesome.  my new fave shoes!"
"The inside of the shoes say ""Ultra sock"" and that is what I would call them. A built in sock look. Very comfy. I was able to get an Amazon Warehouse deal and get them for $20! I am in love with Skechers wide with shoes. I have a hard time with shoes due to having a wide foot and needing something comfortable but stylish for a 30 something mom. I was previously buying ""cute"" Crocs brand, but they only have so many styles that aren't sandals. Plus they aren't cheap on Amazon and there's no store near me (retailers but not a full Crocs store). So if I order online and don't like them, I was stuck unless I wanted to pay return shipping. Free Amazon returns, great shoes. Makes me happy."
Not enough back/heel support. Foot slides right out back. I returned these although I had a bit of a fiasco with that as had ordered a few pair of shoes and sent these to wrong place and place sent them to acted like did not have so ended up having to pay for these. A bit frustrating luckily weren’t too costly but I’m not inclined to try out shoes so much now
"These shoes are fantastic! My feet swell in the summer heat and it is painful to wear shoes. These Skechers are in a wide size, allowing for my swelling. They are super soft and light weight. I am going to buy another pair in a different color."
Love this shoe.  Got several pairs in different colors.  Try to buy a couple of new pair every year because I wear them everyday.
"My last 6 pairs of sneakers have been Sketchers.  I wear them out at the little toe, where they push the material apart.  I like the way they feel with the memory foam. We'll have to see how long these Bounder last at the toe.  Most others last 6 to 12 months."
"The shoes looked good and were what I ordered. Though I got the same size as the ones I had been wearing, these are very tight. Seems to run about a 1/2 size smaller than usual. Other than that, I got what I expected."
"Fit great, the memory cushion is nice and gives you plenty of support. Going to buy a second pair asap."
I bought these 6 months ago overall it is good product but If someone wants to wear it for work and stands for 8 to 10 hours it doesn't help that much
Huh. These are genuinely ugly.
"They are not bad. Just it. I have perfect fot the same size another model skechers and adidas shoes, but these model a little bit small. Quality for sure not the best."
very light and cozy
Can never go wrong with the Skechers memory foam shoe.
"Ein schöner, leichter Stiefel. Hatte ihn in Größe 20 bestellt. Leider sind Stiefel zum hineinschlüpfen nichts für unser Enkelkind. Sie bleibt im Schaft hängen."
Wie immer alles perfekt bei Amazon.
"I have used Teva's since the 90's, but when my last pair died I decided to get something that looked a bit less ""dad sandal"" despite now being a father.  I'd heard good things about Chaco sandals from multiple sources and decided to take the plunge.  Sizing charts are accurate although I found them confusing.  Best thing to do is figure out your shoe size in either centimetres or European sizing and backtrack form there.  I'm normally a size 9 in shoes, but got the size 7 Chaco per the size chart and it fits perfect.Things I've noticed:  The straps are MUCH softer and flexible than Tevas even on the parts that aren't using Velcro.  My feet appreciate that.  The sole has strong and definite arch support so if you have flat feet these might not be for you.  It's also a very wide last, which is good for my hobbit feet, but wouldn't work well if yours were long and narrow.  The foot bed is also very stiff compared to a Teva sandal which I assume means they will last a long time, but also take a few days to break in properly.For me, they fit well and are very comfy to wear.  I'm happy with the style of them as well.  I took a point off because I think they are a tad overpriced in Candada especially with the import fees being tacked on.  If I were in the US, I'd happily pay the amounts being asked."
重さが気になり、返品いたしました。商品も履き心地もとてもよかったのですが・・・。返品処理も箱に入れて引き取りを待つだけなのでとても助かりました。
We are big fans of chacos.  This pair seems fine but in previous pairs the strap around ankle did not hang down so long - once the shoe is secured at ankle there are at least 3 inches of extra that almost drag the ground....not sure why this change in design.  There are videos online of how to tuck up the strap but it seems like a design flaw compared to last models.
"I received my 1st pair with the straps much to small to fit my feet, but I could not adjust the straps at all, like the straps were glued into position.  I returned the 1st pair, asking for a replacement.  The replacement had the same problem, the straps could not be adjusted.  When I returned the 2nd pair I was charged an $18.42 restocking fee despite that they were listed as ""FREE Returns""."
"Really good sandals. I loved that I could just slide them on and start wearing them without having to break them in. There was maybe a slight hassle to adjust the straps after purchase to fit my feet, but otherwise nothing too complicated. I’ve gone hiking and biking in them and haven’t been disappointed with the soles or straps. The only thing I have to say against them is that constant wear is abrasive to the skin, especially the toe straps. I haven’t gotten any blisters (I’m not really prone to them) but they do leave marks that only go away after a couple of days of not wearing them. Otherwise, I love them! Awesome traction, even when wet!"
"I ordered 3 different sandals from different companies and as soon as I tried these on, trying on the other 2 was just a formality. I love the strap design and the high arch (my feet needed it) and the overall build quality is inline with the price. Great buy."
Too small for top of foot. If the straps would move through the loops at ankle we could have adjusted the foot area but it was sewn.
"Love the sandals, but a little heavier than I would have liked so I don’t use them for backpacking as I had originally intended.  They are still awesome for using around home."
"I was a little concerned that these would run a little small (I usually buy size 10 but opted for 9 this time) because I've always had the impression Chacos run a little small. Happy to report that's not the case. These also seem to have a lighter, less clunky sole/base material, which I was not expecting but really, really like. We'll see how these new ones hold up to the daily grind."
"Have owned many pairs of this shoe, usually very durable.  The shoes no longer come with Vibram soles and after only a month and a half of normal use the sole is already delaminating from the shoe.  Unacceptable for this price."
"Toller Schuh, am Schaft recht eng.  Eine Leggings passt rein. Matschhose wird zu eng sein. Für uns wichtig: er hält am Bein.  Fällt bei 20/21 größenmässig wie eine 21 aus."
"Tut was ein Gummistiefel soll, nämlich Füße trocken halten und sieht dabei noch ganz nett aus.."
"Leider war an der Tüte ein Schild Gr 26/27, Inhalt jedoch 24/25.... retour"
Gut
Sehr schöne Gummistiefel.An denen gibt es nichts zu meckern.Sind wasserdicht und mein 14 Monate alter Sohn kann sehr gut drin laufen.
Bellissimi
Sehr schöne Schuhe
Spitze
Ma fille n'a pas pu les mettre car trop petits mais conforme à la description
I like the design. Don't feel very comfortable .
they fit perfect and look perfect... other than the fact that it looks like they had previously been worn. a couple of dirt marks on it but overall they’re still good shoes
Loved them. A little too big tho
Incomodas
"I spent a lot of my childhood barefoot and have struggled for years to find shoes that fit my wide toes, very narrow heel feet.They offer NO arch support which isn’t a problem for me, but could be for others. My shoes fit perfectly and I’m even sure I could add an insole if I wanted.I mainly purchased these as gym shoes that have some sort of toe grip for certain exercises but I’m excited to try them out in the summer time in the river, too!"
Was a great fit for wide feet.  Will not accomodate too well socks (unless they are super thin).I will buy them again.
Seems these are made with less care then I would have hoped for. There is glue clearly used to put the shoe together  that has not been cleaned up at all. And they are too tight to wear. I hope they loosen up with use.
size is true
Very comfortable beautiful purple color
I do like this shoe very comfortable
"My son loves them, he thinks he can run faster with these on. They fit great, & seem durable and comfortable. Look great too."
Great shoes my son love it.
Comodidad
"Great shoe, arrived quite late but product is good"
Bought these for my daughter who absolutely loves them. She is a picky person when it comes to shoes because she has a wide foot which can be hard to find a good looking great fitting shoe. They are perfect for her and she said she never wants to take them off so in all I  am glad I bought them.
"Quality: These do not seem like authentic adidas. They have a very strange look in person. I do not like them at all and nor does my child.Fit: I wouldn’t recommend ordering these but if you do, make sure your kiddo has a narrow foot and order a half size up at least."
"My daughter really likes these shoes and does everything in them. It's just unfortunate that the shiny stripes started peeling off within the first week of wear. Now 3 are peeling off and flapping around and it just looks really sloppy, as though she's been wearing them for a couple years instead of a couple months! My mom got so concerned seeing the state of her shoes a couple weeks ago that she's ordering her another pair 🤣. But, other than making me look like a negligent mom, they're comfortable and lightweight and cute."
"Great looking shoe!  I love the look of these on my son.  As boys do though, he is pretty rough on clothes and shoes.  The fabric that covers the top of the toes (looks like of like mesh) got a couple of small holes in it after a couple of months and now after ~3-4 months of wearing them the entire piece of fabric on the top of the shoe is basically flapping in the breeze it's pulled back so far.  The actual shoe underneath the fabric still seems to be holding up ok, so I guess more of a cosmetic issue, but still annoying.  Not sure I'd buy these again simply because of that, but I did love them for the first couple of months!"
"I thought adidas would offer a quality material but my 6 year old son already was able to wear it out the tip of the shoes within two months. All he has been doing with the shoes is walking, running, biking , playing in recess outside in school. He does not play soccer so kicking or something like that is not the reason why the fronts torn out."
Looked great to start but after a few short weeks the front plastic toe started to crack open. Typical daily use! Would not recommend this product.
"Meravigliose come solo geox li sa fare. Viste al negozio, ma non c'era il numero, poi il prezzo era doppio. Con il prezzo Amazon morbidezza e comodità sono davvero uniche."
"Geox è sempre una garanzia, scarpe comode e calde e zone sempre il piede non suda. Se devo trovare un difetto calzano un po larghe."
"Ottime scarpe, calzano perfettamente e oltre ad essere molto belle esteticamente sono anche estremamente comode."
"En cuanto al producto ni una queja, son muy comodos..., el pero es para el color recibido que aun habiendo pedido marrones me las envían en color gris."
Tutto perfetto
Tutto perfetto
"Tempi brevissimi di consegna ,imballaggio perfetto,prodotto orginale."
Ottima scarpa come sa fare geox
Ok tempi e prodotto
Tutto bene. Consegna ultra rapida
"...nur der Preis ist etwas zu hoch. Diese Schuhe sollten im Preis unter € 28,-- liegen, was sie durchaus wert sind. Lediglich Marke und/oder Beliebtheit treiben den Preis unangemessen hoch."
Hat alles schnell geklappt und der Schuh ist einwandfrei.
"Belle basket, bien découper, jolie finition,tienne bien,couleur bleu gris un peut comme un jeans claire !!"
I love this brand! every pair of shoes or boots I've worn outlast my expectations. I will likely never find a manufacturer like this in my lifetime so I hope they never go out of business. The quality is far better than the average and that's putting it lightly
Arrived in a NON GENUINE Box with NO MERRELL labels of any kind either on the shoes or box. I highly doubt these are genuine. And yes they were from Amazon not a third party seller.
These shoes were comfortable right away. I usually wear a heavier hiker so these are nice and light for the summer
Love these shoes were them to Vegas and walked for Miles no foot pain
"Great shoe, very light, good grips for hiking,Was priced at $60 when I bought them"
"Excellent produit, résistant et confortable."
Merrell is no longer a brand of longevity but it still costs the same as it used to.
Enfin un soulier de marche confortable est qui semble durable :)
"beautiful shoes, thanks Amazon.ca"

"Schnell wurden diese Schuhe geliefert und tatsächlich sind sie eng. Der Reißverschluss kann an meinem Fuss nicht wie bei einem anderen ARA Paar nachträglich geschlossen werden.Das Fußbett ist total angenehm, man läuft ganz anders. Höher, gerader? Wie lange ich es aushalte, werde ich sehen.Außen Leder, Innen ""Frottee""?, Sehr sportlicher Schuh, war mir für den sehr günstigen Preis egal. Viel mehr hätte ich nicht ausgegeben, da der Schuh unerwartet echt eng ist, trotz Schnürung und trotz des Reißverschlusses.Für breite Füsse wurde ich sagen ungeeignet."
Von der Schuhgröße her ideal aber leider zu schmal wer etwas breite Füße hat. Das Fussbett ist zwar weich und ergonomisch aber für 8 Stunden Arbeit mit hin und herlaufen nicht geeignet. Für mich unbequem und die Füße tun schrecklich weh. Ich werde sie als Sommerschuh tragen aber mehr auch nicht. Hätte ich dafür 129€ ausgegeben hätte ich es bereut. Ansich ein gut verarbeiteter Schuh
Wie immer sind die Schuhe von ARA super bequem...innen mit Frottee...schön weich....man läuft wie auf Wolken...bin begeistert...kaufe mir eventuell noch andere Farben wenn sie billiger werden....auf jeden Fall empfehlenswert
"Ein wirklich toller Schuh, läuft sich echt angenehm. Sieht auch zu einem sportlichen Rock richtig gut aus.Für den Preis klare Kaufempfehlung."
Die Schuhe sind getragen oder unter eine Walze gekommen.Sohle kaputt unmöglich so einen Artikel zu verschicken.total dreckig.
Schöner bequemer Schuh
"Elles sont géniales, comme les autres de la marque d'ailleurs !!!"
Bien adapté
Very good looking. But it get dirty pretty easily
"Una scarpa di ottima qualità costruttiva e abbastanza confortevole al piede.✔️ Come tutte le realizzazioni della Geox, anche questo mocassino ha il sistema di traspirazione con membrana che aiuta a tenere fresco il piede mantenendo l’impermeabilità.✔️ Suola in cuoio e tomaia in pelle con finiture di qualità.✔️ Ha un inserto in gomma sul tacco per aumentare il grip ed evitare di scivolare.✔️ Ottima la confezione che comprende, all’interno della scatola, anche un sacchetto per riporre/portare le scarpe e una pezza per pulirle.👉 Molto elegante, da usare per cerimonie e occasioni formali👉 Le ho comprate nere e il colore corrisponde.❌ Al momento dell’acquisto NON era indicato che “Le nostre scarpe vestono comodo, ti consigliamo quindi di scegliere una mezza taglia in meno rispetto alla tua misura abituale”, quindi ho preso esattamente la mia misura di piede. Risultano leggermente abbondanti, ma comunque ancora calzabili senza l’effetto di sentire di avere una taglia di troppo. Seguite comunque le indicazioni e preferite una mezza taglia in meno.❌ Il prezzo un po’ troppo alto quando le ho acquistate lo scorso anno (al momento della recensione costano circa il 30% in meno)"
"Prodotto ottimo come nella tradizione GEOX. Veste grande, corretti quindi i suggerimenti di prendere una mezza taglia in meno."
Prodotto di buona qualità. I materiali sono adeguati e le finiture ottime. Calzata giusta per un pianta normale.
Ottimo
Ottime!
La qualità e buona ma e del 2017
"Scarpa molto scadente ,indossata 3 volte e si è già scollata la suola"
Super shoes
"Love them, this is my first pair and already shopping for another, if your looking for a lot of arch support, there really is not a lot, but I find these very comfy and true to size, got a lot of compliments on them , just my first wearing. You can wear them all day"
very comfy
Love these casual shoes
My daughter loves these. They were true to size and decent for the price. Would buy more. She also gets compliments every time she wears them.
looked great love the color will order more
These were stiff when I first got them but they have broke in some
Absolutely in love with my sunflower shoes. They are perfect 🌻
"Son lindos, pero son demasiado grandes, si pedí mi talla pero igual están muy grandes"
"Cute and comfy, but they do run big"
"The shoes would be awesome if they weren't so huge. I got my regular size, but they're way too big. Tried them on and they were roomy, so I wanted to wear them to see how they'd work out, but I can't wear them because my feet slide around. Super disappointed, they're super cute."
LOVE THESE SHOES
"Beautiful shoe, but too narrow.Edit: I ended up keeping them and donating to a neighborhood kid."
My son loved them so much he wore them everywhere. Too bad they don’t last as long .. but it could be that he did overuse them .
"True to size, great quality, laces are not too short and not too long. My son said they’re comfy"
Shoes seemed nice but my son has wide feet and these did not work.  Some adidas shoes run wide but these did not.
My 9 year old son uses these for indoor soccer and loves them.
my son loved them.great fit.
They fit perfectly
Muy bueno pero muy frande
PERFECTO TAL CUAL LO ESPERABAMOS
So comfy
"reinschlüpfen und loslaufen. Bequem, wie erwartet. Andere Schuhe müssen oft eingelaufen werden, war bei diesem Paar nicht erforderlich."
Excellent produit à enfiler et très confortables!
"Son muy cómodos. Los utilizo para trabajar, en especial en las guardias."
"I purchased this pair because I wanted another sneaker from Ecco, but I wanted something that was a slip-on with a less traditional style than the lace-up sneaker of which I have 5 pair from Ecco in various colors, and this fit the bill.  As with all Eccos, I can fit my custom orthotic inside with ease and somehow it does not compromise the fit of the shoe whatsoever (I wear a half orthotic which only supports the heel and arch of my foot and does not go to the toe).  The arch support without the orthotic is fair on its own and the bottom is more flexible than the other Ecco sneakers that I have, but I expected that with the style of this shoe and was what I wanted.  The sole of this shoe is not rigid so if you need that this will not provide that for you.  It is an extremely light shoe and breathable which is perfect for the warmer months.  Lately these are the pair that I grab the most and get a lot of compliments on them. They’re different than the average sneaker. They are sleeker and extremely comfortable and work with a lot of outfits, obviously more casual looks but I did wear them with skorts and cute top on vacation recently and they were perfect.  Also, great at airports when you need to slip your shoes off when going through security and super comfortable when you’re just sitting in your seat for hours on the plane ride, and really light to pack.  Highly recommend."
I got these to wear at work - I'm in medical and live in scrubs.  I'm on my feet all day.  These are so comfy and adorable!  I get so many compliments on them :)  I wear a 7.5 and I ordered a 38.  Fits PERFECT!!
I like Ecco shoes.  I have a couple of pairs.  I was looking for something to slip in and out easily for work with arch support.  These fit the image but they scratched the top of my foot.  There is no inner lining so everything feels rough.  Had to return.
"Not like other pairs of Ecco I have - too short. Also, even though my instep is almost non existent, it was too tight around my foot to the point when it becomes painful after a couple of minutes just having them on. Sent them back."
"Liked the style and color.  I tend to need a narrow heel with a medium width foot bed.  Ecco usually works for me, but this shoe slipped in the heel and I had to return them.  They ran wider than usual."
Super comfy for doing a lot of walking in the airport and travels. A snug fit to put on but didn't slip on my narrow heel. Plenty of room in the toe box.
I've had it for just a few months and its starting to wear. The other ecco shoes I have keep going for years
"I'm new to the world of variable sized shoes, but these feel great for walking, around the house, and even a little basketball.  Regarding size/fit, order wider than your usual.  I am slow to criticize on fit since I am just figuring out variable sized footwear.  But even compared to other Propet footwear, this one is much narrower.  The photo is two right Propet shoes, both size 14 and width 5E.  Note that the strap of the black shoe completely covers the Velcro, but the grey sneaker was close to not being wide enough with about an inch of Velcro showing.  So far it's holding with less Velcro contact.  I hope so since that's their widest width, and these feel great."
"The tongues have a lot of loose threads on both shoes. Its really comfy otherwise and breathes extremely well. I don't like seeing so many loose threads though. It makes me wonder how many other spots that I haven't or can't see have sewing problems, too. Its a shame because its very comfy otherwise."
"I purchased these for my brother who lives in a nursing home. We both loved the looks of the shoes and the fit was right on target. I returned them because when he tried them on I saw the soles seemed to stick to the carpet a bit. I was afraid he'd fall, which he is already inclined to do, because he doesn't pick up his feet well. There were other shoes I ordered which did not exhibit this problem."
"I bought these for my husband and he absolutely loves them. Good fit, good stability, excellent quality.Would definitely recommend."
I bought this pair for the gym. Its very difficult to tighten the shoe enough that I won't step out of it while working out
If you have young healthy feet this product may be for you. I have wide worn down feet and this shoe has zero support. It is easy to operate but the padding is less then effective.
"I liked the way that the shoe fit. I have always had problems with wide feet. They are my go to shoes for outside and to the gym, however, after two months of usage and outside of the return policy, the sides of the shoes are pulling apart. I would not buy them again."
"bought these late in season, may be wrong choice fo winter ."
"I was hesitant to purchase these sneakers for my son because I was unfamiliar with the brand. However, my son loves the fit, comfort and style."
"They worked out well for a work environment that eats shoes, held out longer than several other Shoes I've tried, They wore out after 5 months, but that's at 6 days a week in a warehouse job for 10 hours a day. Not bad when they went on sale for around $45"
Super schöner Schuh! Meine Kleine liebt ihn!Wir werden ihn wieder kaufen! Für zierliche Füße geeignet. Sehr hochwertig verarbeitet! Wir nutzen ihn auch als Ballerina für außen!Meine 2 Jährige schaft es prima sie selbständig an und auszuziehen.
"Sehr schöne Schuhe in bewehrter Qualität. Sie passen wie erwartet, sind gut verarbeitet und rutschfest. Meine Tochter kann sie mit dem Klettverschluss selbst anziehen und trägt sie sehr gerne."
"Die Schühchen können nicht nur als Hausschuhe getragen werden. Sie sind sehr leicht, die Sohle flexibel, aber für schmale Füße geeignet."
"Not only are they very stylish and chic, they're also well-built, sturdy and very easy to clean. Not the cheapest slippers but they are definitely worth every penny."
"Zuckersüße Hausschuhe, nur haben sich nach nur zweimaligem Tragen die kleinen applizierten Blümchen abgelöst. Sehr schade für Schuhe mit diesem Preis."
Tolle Sommerhausschuhe. Qualität und Größe wie gewohnt von Living Kitzbühel!! Absolute Kaufempfehlung!!!
If you're at all familiar with the Clarks reputation for comfortable shoes then there is really no need to read any reviews as Clarks are always a good decision and this pair of shoes is no different. I can wear these shoes for hours without my foot feeling any pain and they're breathable enough to prevent the shoe from getting too hot inside and creating an atmosphere in which odors can fester. The shoes look just as they do in the pictures so there's no surprises there either.
Sneaker is comfortable and looks good. Shoelaces come untied easily. These things are noises. It makes a squishing noise as I walk. They are expensive for what you get. You could buy almost 3 pairs of Sketchers for this price.
Hermosos
"The product is genuine and exactly as described .. happy with it, just hope the size chart to have more options for British sizes"
Pair is little bigger I would like to return this pair and I want to get in size:10.
👍 liked it
"Los zapatos son para mi bebé de casi 2 años pero los compré un poco más grandes ya que conseguí una super oferta por Amazon. Los zapatos son originales y fueron enviados desde Estados Unidos. No tuve que pagar tax ni ningún impuesto al llegar a México pues ya venían incluidos en el precio. Una real oferta pues no pague más de 400 pesos por los zapatos originales cuando en la tienda New Balance no bajan de 1000 pesos.  Excelente calidad y materiales  Se los guardo hasta que ya le queden sin embargo, soy feliz!"
Calidad insuperable fáciles de limpiar y el material es muy resistente contra agua la verdad son mis favoritos!!! El precio inigualable!!
"Pésimo, se supone que son hechos para que tengan buena resistencia y por eso los compre. Pero desafortunadamente no duraron ni 6 meses y eso que solo fueron usados en casa. Ni siquiera para ir al parque al algo similar"
"Super buen precio/calidad. Mi hijo no se los quita, están muy cómodos y no se ensucian tan fácil."
A buen precio puesto en Mexico
"El producto es de calidad, se ven geniales! Le encantaron a mi hijo."
"En general están bien, siento que la suela se resbala un poco y no son muy acolchonados por dentro."
El color está increíble y llegaron al tiempo que indicaron
Estan muy bonitos y quedaron super bien
Muy emocionado y contento quedó al niño.  Gracias 🙂
"Me gustaron mucho, son muy bonitos y de excelente calidad... Pero, hablando de comodidad, no son cómodos realmente."
"El modelo, diseño y comodidad son excelentes, solo la tela del teni se debe tener los cuidados necesarios ya que están algo frágiles."
"Al ser calzado Americano suele venir un poco mas amplio, el diseño es padre y el tiempo de entrega genial."
Muy cómodos pero deberían poner numeración en cm
Excelentes
Me encantaron! Son verdaderamente bellos!!
"I’m a 6.5 narrow, I bought these because I needed a snicker that could hold my ankle while working out after an injury. That’s not the shoe for that. The high top style is really for style, there is no ankle hold. I was also struggling a lot to get my foot in and out.Looks really cute, it’s light weight, but I had to send it back, it was too much of a hassle and did not fit my purpose."
I love puma shoes! It is basically all I wear. But very disappointed when my shoes arrived and I opened to see them with stains on them and look as if they been worn prior to sending. And it’s a real hassle to return right now during all this stuff going on. I fe like I just got swindled out of my money
"Comfortable, cute, lightweight and true to size. Personally love these. I use them to workout and not outside just because I don’t wanna get them dirty"
"Love these shoes. Purchased these for more ankle support when working out. They provide great support overall, a firm sole while not being so stiff that it’s uncomfortable."
I've had the older version of these for years and they've served me well. I bought these and didn't bother breaking them in this winter because I found them narrow even though they said wide. I'll work on breaking them in though and hope they do me for years like the older ones.
"Me gusta mucho el zapato columbia, protege mucho mis pies, no me cansa.  este modelo en especial, viene un poco más amplio de lo normal, manejo 7.5 en mis compras,  sin embargo me lo quedé, solo uso un calcetín más grueso.el color es combinable con mucha ropa. lo uso para andar en la ciudad. Recomendable"
"I love this shoe. Very very comfortable. Im between 9.5 and 10, I took size 10 M and it's perfect for a foot that isn't wide. Solid yet flexible."
Súper bonitos para usarse hasta para ir al súper me dolía la rodilla y el dolor se fue cuando me puse los tenis del diario en lugar de sandalias los recomendó
"Great shoes, look just like picture. I ordered half size up for socks. Fit perfectly seem like a great quality product. Super happy!"
"Love these shoes!  I have wide feet and they’re super comfy.  I probably could have got the 8.5s, but with socks the 9s are great.  They feel great on, heavy duty but comfortable."
"Todo bien con la compra. Zapato rígido, tal y como debe ser."
Like that it is water proof
Great for walking on both smooth and rougher pathways. Also used them for golf - great traction.
"Cumplieron su objetivo, hice senderismo en un bosque lluvioso y tuvieron buen agarre, a pesar de que no son waterproof soportaron bien la lluvia y el lodo."
"Ich liebe die Schuhe. Sehr gutes laufgefühl, halten sogar etwas warm, gut gepolzterte einlegesohle schon drin. Material Färbt nicht ab, bis 150kg super gut belastbar auch zum joggen geeignet."
"Ich habe mir gedacht, dass diese Schuhe eine gute Dämpfung haben müssten und habe mich deshalb für sie entschieden. Ein anderes Modellsprach mich zwar mehr an, war in meiner Größe aber nicht mehr zu bekommen. Sie sind ganz fix gekommen, ohne viel unnötige Verpackung und haben nicht auffällig gerochen. Normale Passform und mit Sneaker oder Socken super zu tragen, reinzwängeln muss ich mich auch nicht.Schuhlöffel reicht, vorne über dem Spann richten/hochziehen und los geht's. Habe sie einen Vormittag im Haus getragen und mittags dann wegen warmer Füße ausgezogen. Ich empfand sie als angenehm, nicht zu locker und die Dämpfung war so, wie ich sie mir vorgestellt habe.Ich habe Probleme mit den Gelenken und deshalb diese dicken Sohlen. Wären sie als ""Schietwetterschuhe"" zu bekommen, für Hundespaziergänge, würde ich mich freuen. Meine Tochter sucht sich bereits welche für die Kita. als Hausschuhe aus.Wenn Sie jetzt noch gut halten, dann war das die absolut richtige Wahl(für mich)."
"Am Schuh ansich gibt's nicht zu meckern. Allerdings würde ich beim nächsten Kauf eine Nummer größer bestellen. Trage eine normale 38, jedoch durch dich Machart und ohne Schnürung, zieht sich der Schuh sehr schwer an. Ist man erstmal drin, sitz er gut aber doch eine Nummer größer. Trotzdem bin ich mit dem Schuh zufrieden"
"An sich bestimmt ein toller Schuh wenn man nicht gerade angeschwollene 9-Monats-Schwangerschaftsfüße hat.Habe die Schuhe geholt, da ich (gerade bei dem aktuellen Wetter) rutschfeste Schuhe brauche in die man auch (aufgrund des mittlerweile dicken Bauch) einfach rein schlüpfen kann.Leider empfand ich die Artikelbeschreibung als etwas irreführend, da ich davon ausging dass der gesamte Fuß aus elastischem Material bestehen und sich somit dem Fuß anpassen würde. Da ich ziemliche Wassereinlagerungen in den Beinen/Füßen  habe und nur der ""Eingang"" elastisch ist, kam ich jedoch nicht mal ansatzweise in den Schuh hinein, weswegen er zurück gehen wird.Schade, rutschfest und bequem wirkte er dennoch."
"Wirklich schöne Schuhe, preisgünstig und sehen gut verarbeitet aus. Aber und jetzt kommt das ABER: Ich hab wirklich keine sonderlich breiten Füße. Eher normal. Mir passen sonst alle Schuhe, aber diese hier waren viel zu eng. Nicht nach vorne hin sondern an den Seiten. Nach 1h tragen hatte ich unglaubliche Fußschmerzen bekommen weil durchgehend ein starker Druck von den Seiten herrschte. Schade, ich habe mich nämlich Anfangs sehr gefreut, weil die Schuhe klasse aussehen.Habe die Schuhe heute schweren Herzen Retour geschickt...Update: Retour und Erstattung gingen Problemlos und sehr schnell über die Bühne!"
"Ich hätte doch eine halbe Nummer größer bestellen sollen. Ich brauchte die Schuhe dringend, sodass ich für den Umtausch etc. keine Geduld hatte.Da sie ja aus Stoff sind, haben sie sich noch etwas geweitet, somit sind sie jetzt sehr bequem. Ich laufe sehr viel damit, verwende sie allerdings zum Gassi gehen und nicht zum joggen.Würde sie wieder kaufen."
Von der Größe her passt es sehr gut leider ist der Schuh nur für schmale Füße geeignet. Werde also warten bis mein sohn die Größe erreicht hat und sie ihm dann geben für mich persönlich nicht das wahre. Wenn man von der enge absieht steht man sehr gut darin und kann auch super laufen.
"Die Schuhe sind genial.Ich habe schon ähnliche von Skechers,die aber nicht so gut passen wie diese.Absolut empfehlenswert!!!Die Sohle ist ganz weich und die Schuhe bequem.Preis-Leistung ist top!Für Skechers Schuhe bezahlt man locker das doppelte.Ich habe die Schuhe jetzt knapp drei Monate je nach Wetterlage in Gebrauch und ich muss sagen Qualität ist super.Es muss nicht immer nur ein Markenprodukt sein."
"Die Qualität und Verarbeitung der Schuhe scheint in Ordnung zu sein. Auch optisch gefällt er mir.Er ist schmal geschnitten und leider fällt die Größe etwas knapp aus, ein halbe Größe mehr wäre toll. Allerdings weiß ich noch nicht wie sich der Schuh nach längerem Tragen verhält..das Obermaterial ist aus nachgibigem, gestrickten Stoff. Wird nach längerem Tragen das Material  nachgeben?...schreibe später nochmal eine Anmerkung dazu.Leider musste ich die Schuhe zurück senden, da sie doch zu klein und schmal sind."
Der Schuh ist super bequem und leicht. Durch die Puffersohle sehr Rücken und Hüftfreundlich.Was mir nicht gefällt ist das er vorne an der Zehenkuppe ausbeult. Die Rundung könnte etwas stabiler sein so dass  diese nicht aus ihrer Form gerät. Beim Tragen entstehen unschöne Dellen. Ich stopfe sie nach dem Tragen immer mit Zeitungspapier aus damit die Dellen nicht bleiben und um die Rundung wieder schön zu machen.Daher 1 Punkt Abzug.
"Auf diese Hausschuhe bin ich aufgrund einer Empfehlung gestoßen. Zu Beginn hat mich der recht hohe Preis für Kinderhausschuhe doch etwas abgeschreckt, aber ich bereue den Kauf auf keinen Fall. Eher im Gegenteil: Nachdem ich diese Schuhe meinem Sohn angezogen habe und eine Woche ihn damit beobachtet habe, kann ich diese Hausschuhe zu 100% weiterempfehlen. Mit der rutschfesten Sohle, die super flexibel ist, fühlt sich der Schuhe wie ein Barfußschuh an und auch die Qualität des gesamten Schuhs hat uns sehr überzeugt. Der Schuhe ist sogar für breite Füße gut geeignet. Bei uns werden definitiv nur noch Nanga Hausschuhe einziehen."
"Komplett flexible Sohle und sehr gute Breite, definitiv als Barfuß-Hausschuhe zu bezeichnen. Die Sohle ist abwaschbar und gibt einen rutschfesten Halt. Der Schuh ist sowieso bei 30 Grad waschbar. Aus Biobaumwolle und Naturkautschuk. Das Gangbild war sofort perfekt und wer mit den neuen Hausschuhen gleich losflitzen kann, hat die richtigen Schuhe. Der Preis ist angemessen."
"Supertolle Hausschuhe, wie ich finde. ""Barfussschuhe"" sozusagen = sehr weiche und dünne Sohle, rutschfest, aber ohne Profil und ohne Fussbett, so dass die Kinderfüsse natürlich gehen können und so eigentlich ein Barfussfeeling für den Fuss entsteht und die Koordination und Bewegungsentwicklung frei und natürlich stattfinden kann, trotzdem sind sie geschützt und gewärmt. Ist schon unsere vierte Grösse glaube ich. Kaufe nur die, bin sehr überzeugt und zufrieden!"
"Erst einmal muss man sagen lt. Testberichte sollen diese Schuhe ohne Chemie auskommen. Das kann mein Geruchstest nur bestätigen. Fühlen sich gut an und sind leicht. Jetzt kommt das ABER. Was ich schade finde, wir hätten sie gern behalten.In der Länge fallen sie etwas größer aus, leider ist der Spann zu eng. Der Gummizug ist nicht flexibel genug. Das ist wirklich ärgerlich. Hier sollte nachgebessert werden! Dann ist es ein Top Schuh!"
"Wir hatten noch nie Hausschuhe, die nach kurzem, unregelmäßigem Tragen so ausgesehen haben, nicht mal um ein vielfaches günstigere. Ich habe beim 1. Mangelpaar Ersatz angefordert und das Ersatzpaar sieht jetzt so aus, also habe ich jedenfalls kein Montagsprodukt erwischt. Ich kann die guten Rezensionen überhaupt nicht nachvollziehen; bei uns ist Nanga unten durch."
"Le pantofole sono carine, ma non sono adatte al piede del mio bimbo, l' elastico sul collo del piede gli stringeva troppo. Ma il servizio clienti Amazon è stato perfetto, le ho mandate indietro e mi hanno restituito i soldi."
"Con Nanga vado sul sicuro, in più le ho trovate ad un prezzo davvero stracciato. Sono ottime per i piedini dei bimbi perchè hanno la suola impermeabile ed isolata dal pavimento ma ultraflessibile. Assolutamente identiche a pantofone similari della concorrenza che costano ben di più."
Mio figlio appena indossate ha esordito con “sono comodissime Mamma!!!”. Ottimo acquisto sia come qualitá che come modello. Un po’ strette da infilare ma una volta indossate il bambino può giocare liberamente. Io le ho comprate per l’asilo e le consiglio vivamente!
"Habe den Schuh in Größe 22 für meine Tochter bestellt. Obwohl er grundsätzlich vorne gut passt und sie noch etwas Luft hat, ist er durch den unverstellbaren Gummizug wahnsinnig eng, obwohl sie keinen breiten Fuß hat. Man kommt so kaum in den Schuh hinein und er muss dadurch unbequem sein, denn er wird meist direkt wieder ausgezogen. Schade, denn laut aktuellen Testberichten enthält er keine bedenklichen Rückstände. Werde vielleicht einen anderen Schuh dieser Marke versuchen,  der ein Riemchen hat und nicht dieses feste Gummiband."
"Die Hausschuhe sind ein echter Hingucker,von guter Qualität und halten gut am relativ schmalen Fuß unseres Sohnes. Der Schuh ist bei uns seit 2,5 Monaten im Kindergarten in Gebrauch... bis jetzt sind keine Abnutzungserscheinungen aufgetreten."
Son hermosos!Yo los agarré con descuento y no me arrepiento de haberlos compradoSon muy lindo y están muy cómodosLas agujetas venían un poquito manchadas pero es lo de menosAún no he salido con ellos puestos pero me los probé y están geniales
"Me gustan que sean blancos, obviamente se ensucian mucho pero hay que lavarlos y vuelven a quedar como antes"
Excelente producto
Buen diseño y muy cómodos
"Muy buen producto! Solo que vienen reducidos en tamaño, pidan medio número mas grande o hasta el número completo."
"Está exactamente como lo quería, me encantó!!!. Excelente calidad y llegó antes del tiempo pactado."
Totalmente  satisfecho cumple con todo además de que están mejor que en las fotos
"El tallaje esta muy bien, llegaron antes de lo indicado."
Excelente artículo
Súper cómodos y hermosos!
These are perfect even for an adult.I am a women’s size 8. I was told that’s a youth / big kids size 6.These fit perfect with like a 1/2 inch to spare which I like the room in slippers.These were a little hard and stiff out of the box but what slippers arnt?These are awesome! I love them. They are my new favs. I have other ugg ones that keep my feet too hot. I love these more. These are great. I recommend them.  They will break in with time. I love the look. I know they will last longer then a $20 pair that break down in a week. I wish I could leave photos.
"I am an adult who wears a child's size 3 shoe. It is difficult for me to find a very comfortable, durable, adult looking slipper.  These are perfect.  They are not too wide, like most children's shoes  I buy. My floors are hard and the thick cushioned soles are wonderful to my feet.  I will wear them from my living room outdoors to water my patio plants.  The suede is durable, quality material and water spots just fade away.  The fur lining keeps my feet warm as well. Even in the summer months my feet stay cold.  I praise the manufacturers of these slippers."
Super cute slippers but much roomier than other UGG scuff slippers.  There is no sheepskin on the top underside of the slipper which makes the fit different than other styles.  Length is the same.
Love the leopard print and best of all it is warm and saves my legs from standing on tile. Ugg’s are my favorite slippers during winter.
I got a size 6 big kids and I am a size 8 in women’s. They fit perfect. I love these so much!!! The only thing the sole is a little hard but over time I know uggs get soft and adapt to your foot. So it’s all good. Would recommend.
"Super cute, high quality UGG slippers with non-slip sole; extremely comfortable and stylish. Fits true to size."
There great 😊
The footbed is very firm.  Returned these to get something with memory foam.
Unlike other UGG slippers I've purchased this pair had thin sole and little support.
My 5 year old loves them
"Der Schuh sieht gut aus und passt perfekt (auch mit Orthopädieeinlagen) .Das Leder ist ""Butterweich"" und passt sich so gut meinem Fuss an ohne an Stabilität zu verlieren. Immer wieder..."
"I have been a lifetime wearer and enthusiast of the Stacy Adams brand.  I purchased this boot style a little over 3 months ago; and only wore them, to try them on.  However this morning I decided it was time to put the boots in action.  Once I lifted the rear of the boot to my dismay ""RIP!"" the back of the boot tore open.  That was a disappointing. But maybe it's just this pair, I'll repair and keep them anyway."
I'm a HUGE Stacy Adams fan and these boots did NOT let me down!!! Since they're legit leather expect them to be stiff at first.  Great craftsmanship and quality.  This makes a great addition to a dapper wardrobe.
"Great shoe( boot) fit well little stiff but broke in well! I would say more a D width, good quality, would buy again"
"Love these boots, fit and quality very good."
"Bought for my husband for Christmas, he loves them!"
Great shoes.
"Very comfortable,Looks Great,  get lots of compliments!Works for dress-up or dress-down"
Look great and return policy was great when needed to resize.
Love these and so does my kid.  Comfy shoes for running and playing.  Nice colors with gray and teal.  Fit true to size.  We buy this style of Puma often.
Comode e leggere
Están muy bonitos y a muy buen precio
"Bonitos, cómodos y a buen precio"
"I recently joined an adult kickball league at the request of a friend (don't laugh - this is real thing.  To be clear, I initially was only in it for the booze after the games).  We play on a softball field, and while running bases (OK, ONE base, it wasn't plural) I noticed my running shoes didn't have a really good grip on the ground.  A lot of folks on my team have been in the league for several years and have cleats, so I decided to plunge in and get some cleats.I liked these ones initially because of they were neutral colors and they didn't have plastic-like cleats.They fit just as expected.  They offer a lot of support (and my arches are virtually nonexistant).  I wish they had a little more ankle support."
"I don't use these for sport. I use them to cut my lawn that is on a slope. Good grip,  but a bit uncomfortable."
"My yard has some steep hills so I bought these to help me maneuver.  Great support for feet and ankles.  For the price I was afraid they would be cheaply made however they are NOT.  Great shoes for a great price.  I go up and down my hills with ease and assurance of not slipping.  When I need to work in one area, there is no fear of sliding when pulling and cutting under brush.  LOVE THESE SHOES>"
"Great Cleat for the price and at a good time. Most Fastpitch cleats are sold out or in the 70.00 or higher area at this time. I got these for 34.00 and they are extremely nice. My daughter happens to like adidas cleats already. This is her 3rd pair. At first she seemed a little clunky in them so I checked her old afterburner cleats, and well...... she had worn the metal down to NOTHING. I took them to my grinder and took a little off of each spike and a little more off the super worn ones. Next day she ran out a triple in 8 seconds."
I am now 82 years old and am fearful to walk on ice or snow here in NC.  I used to wear these when I pitched in my Slow-Pitch SoftballLeague many years ago and decided they would be a perfect remedy to keep me from falling.  Now I have to wait till in snows herebecause it rarely ever does - but now I’m READY !!
Junk I bought these shoes for my granddaughter to play softball and she wore about 15 times and now there’s a crack on the bottomTry to upload a photo or take a picture picture of it it just gives me the runaround check settings I check my settings and they’re turned on to upload photos also have the camera still cannot share a pic
I am disappointed these have metal cleats! This is our first time buying softball cleats and I didn’t realize molded plastic is what is expected at her playing level.
So happy with these!  Price was great and now I can garden on my hill without sliding down and speaking French at the same time!
Sehr angenehme Schuhe elegant und Qualität
"They are cheaply made. They smellHorrible. The zippers came all messed up and barely functional. And above all, they are sized like children’s shoes. I don’t have wide feet at all and I couldn’t even get my toes in the shoes. What an absolute waste of my money."
Super nice.  Super soft
Very comfortable shoes. Thank you for a fast delivery
"Bonjour,je suis très déçue, car acheté la paire de chaussure en février 2020 et après le confinement elle ne sont pas du tout imperméable.Donc je demande le remboursement ou l'échange ci les nouvelles sont imperméable comme le précise le garantie.Merci par avance de me donner les modalités pour avoir enfin une paire de chaussure garantie imperméable comme précisé sur le coupon. Merci par avance de votre réponse Cordialement"
OK
Excellent product from FJ as usual.
"The media could not be loaded.
                




   EVERY STEP, both shoes, makes a clicking sound. Wow - so bothersome unless you want to annoy your golf buddy when he is putting."
These really really run big. I use 10 W and its almost a full size too large. That’s odd for a FJ shoe!It’s an ok shoe; expected more from FJ. They are confortable but hard. It should have more cushion and arc support. I am buying arc and cushion insoles that should correct these two big shortfalls and try to save this $120 fiasco
"Foot Joy shoes are the best shoe in support, comfort, and traction... love the style and colors! I have the blue pair and the white pair. Will be playing in AZ next week so will not be a test to the water resistance!!Arrived quickly. They fit true to size!I have narrow feet but ordered the regular width and they feel fine... since s lot of shoes don’t come in several selections of widths, I’m used to this fit.  Highly recommend Foot Joy if you haven’t tried them!"
I direct golf commercials for a living- Ive used every brand on the planet- these shows are junk- they spandex material is so stiff that it will cut into your ankles without super long socks. I hate anything but ankle socks/ these aren’t great shoes
"I like the look of the shoe and that it’s waterproof, but if you wear short socks this may not be your best pick. The elastic at the top of the shoe pulls your sock down. What’s worse is that the soft elastic isn’t soft and cuts into your heel if/when your socks slip.If you wear long socks, this is a great shoe. For those that don’t, I’m sure there are better ones."
"I've not yet played a round with these.  As usual with FootJoys, the quality appears great, they seem a little large for 9Wide, nothing a Dr. Scholl's charcoal filter pad doesn't tighten up.  These are replacing 10 year old FootJoys, that are not close to being worn out, I just got tired of replacing cleats."
"I wore these for the first time and they are very light weight and comfortable.  They are also stable as a golf shoe should be.  Haven't gone out early yet to test the waterproofing, but FJ's are normally good.  Also, these run more true to size than the DNA's.  I went a half size bigger than my DNA's and they fit fine."
"J’ai toujours aimé les Reebok et je devais m’en procurer de nouvelles pour y ajouter des orthèses, actuellement on ne retrouve que des chaussures foncées et je voulais des blanches, alors j’ai ce que je désirais!"
"I looked at a lot of reviews and took heed to going up a size. I have fat feet and I wear a size 10. I got the sneakers in a 10.5 and was a great choice. The sneakers are very comfortable and since I went up a half a size, I have room for my feet to grow. I love the royal blue. I love the sneakers. I haven't worn the shoes yet so I will let you know if anything changes. The shoes look just like the picture...the sneakers are too cute!! I can wear them with jeans, shorts or basically anything.***Update******I have worn the shoes and they are so comfortable. I love to wear them with jeans or shorts. These shoes match with just about everything I wear when it's blue. The shoes are on the more dark blue side. I love my old school Reeboks. I am glad I made the purchase for these sneakers. Do go up a half a size, especially with fat feet like mines..lol. Lovin' my shoes."
"Sometimes, you look and search for the perfect sneaker, well I have purchased many pairs of sneaker throughout my 70 years and these and so perfect, so comfortable, and not one area of this  shoe did I feel discomfort or a pinch.I just wanted a nice pair of sneakers to wear with jeans and they're perfect.Love the feel, they are very softlove the color, its a very subtle blueI am extremely please with this purchase and will definitely buy these again. I know I will purchase a white pair, when my present white ones die.Wonderful purchase and will buy again."
These are not the Reebok princess shoe you fondly remember.  They’re not leather.  They are stiff and very narrow and don’t let your feet breathe at all.  A big disappointment!
"El producto es bueno y de calidad,pero en cuestión de las tallas son confusas, seleccione una talla de 26.50 cm y la talla que me trajeron fue la 6 1/2 US, que es la equivalente a la talla de 25 cm, por suerte lo pude usar como regaloPero si deben mejorar esto, ya que no especifica si la selección de la talla que traen es en cm o pulgadas"
"The shoes are amazing but if you are ordering regular fit meaning not wide please order one size bigger. I ordered a 7M and when I try the shoes it feel like it was a 5M. I had to returned the shoes and I lost $ 8.18 in the whole process, I guess in shipping and restocking."
I will start by saying I love ASICS shoes and buy them exclusively as my workout shoes.This pair was a little less expensive. I thought I was getting a deal but they aren’t really on par with what I’ve had in the past. Not a lot of support for the foot in the front of the shoe and not a lot of tread/grip on the sole. Not good for running or walking in even slightly wet conditions as they slip very easily. Ok for the treadmill.Will get a slightly higher end pair of ASICS next time.
"The shoe is stiff and hard and ran a bit on the small side for me. It squeezed my feet together and after a few hours, my feet was hurting."
Los compré para regalo de cumple de mi sobrina y le encantaron! Son sus tenis favoritos... Llegaron a tiempo y la calidad es la que distingue a Asics
"I purchased this pair of shoes to replace this exact brand & style shoe.  I have needed to replace the insole with a thinker one that has a better arch & a bit more cushion.  Otherwise, these shoes fit as my previous Reebok’s did. I wear these as Winter shoes.  Our winters are fairly mild here in Texas, so this type of shoe works well.  The black color works well with most jeans/slacks."
"la calidad es muy buena, en tiempo de engrega fue muy rapida, gracias por su profesionalismo"
"These are affordable and comfortable so they're like my house shoes for running errands.  They are simple so they will match a simple outfit or a jazzed up outfit.  You always need a black pair of black shoes and these are easy to clean.  When they start to looking to rough, I just order another pair maybe every 8 months."
Muy cómodas.
"I was a able to order these on Amazon because we own other Reebok Classics and we know how they fit.  But if this is your first time buying, I would recommend trying them on in a store if you can.  They look super cool, but they tend to run quite narrow.  I have wide feet so I have to order at least one size up."
"La talla es perfecta, cómodos para correr"
"these shoes have changed, i've been buying these for years and they always fit great.  this pair is very snug.  i've only tried them on i havent worn them anywhere so maybe they will stretch out a little bit.  i'm hoping so.  but just trying them on it was hurting my toes so when i do where them the first time it will probably only be around the house to see if i can stretch them a little.  it says these are wide but they dont feel like it."
"Used for an indoor shoe, and daily use, this was exactly what my wife wanted."
Excelente producto
It is OK but not very great shoe.
Muy bonito par de tenis

"First and foremost, I am from NYC and anyone that's from there knows timbs are one of the unoffical trademarks of the 5 boroughs...lol...so with that being said, this was my first time purchasing them from Amazon, but the third time throughout the years getting them for my 4 year old son. I had the hardest time finding these boots in his size, as we no longer live in NYC so needless to say I was elated when I found them on Amazon. They arrived in their trademark box and perfect. He is at the awkward stage where he is in between sizes, so I purchased a 10 in toddlers. He definitely has room in them, but that gives him room to grow into them and I know they will not hurt in the long run. Overall I am pleased with my purchase and will be a returning customer when its time to purchase them again."
"I am a very short 19 year old who works a construction type job - I'm on my feet all day, lifting things like concrete, shingles, and lumber. I bought these boots because tennis shoes were leaving my feet too vulnerable.I was pleased with the boots for the most part. They provided protection and kept sawdust, gravel, and concrete out. The treads had better grip than tennis shoes, so I slipped less. I wore them all winter, where I had to go out in the cold several times a day, and these kept my feet decently warm. Wouldn't recommend them as winter boots, though. They aren't water proof, so if I was in the snow for too long, my feet got wet. Still better protection from the elements than tennis shoes.I'm a little disappointed with the durability, though. It was only about 4 months until I started getting holes in the leather near the sole. I continued to wear them for another 4 months. They're not completely unwearable, but there are several holes in both boots. I only got to wear them for 8 months before having to replace them - for almost $70, I was hoping for more. I will look for something more durable for my next pair.I would recommend these as hiking boots, but be sure to treat them with water repellant first. Good for medium wear, but not really for heavy use."
"This is an awesome boot to wear on a nice winter day as far as the color Wheat Nubuck. However if it's nasty outside, the darker colors in this boot is perfect but not for shoveling snow. I ordered a boys size 6. I am a 8.5 or 9 in women shoes. I don't wear thick socks so the length and width is fine. If you wear thick socks you should go up to a boys size 6.5."
"THIS PRODUCT DOESNT DESERVE EVEN ONE STAR (but I had to select it n order to submit my review!) I'm so disgusted that THESE BOOTS R SO FAKE! It's TOTALLY obvious to the naked eye, u just can't tell from their pic. Real Timbs r much heavier, have 4 rows of stitching (instead of 2, nice try) & r of better quality (leather/suede/nubuck) & also weatherproof. I'm not sure what fabric these r made of but it's cheap and the ones I received all appear to b wiped off which is weird because I ordered 3 pair from 3 different groups: toddler, little kids & big kids. Maybe if this were my first time owning a pair i could've been fooled but then again they're so cheaply made I strongly doubt it! I foolishly purchased these even after seeing another reviewer have a complaint of their boots separating after just 2-3 wears; I just thought maybe that individual pair was defective. I should've known better since Ive ALWAYS paid way more for ALL of my other Timbs. I just saw the price & thought they were too good of a deal to pass up especially since Timberlands prices have skyrocketed ridiculously this past year. I spent slightly less than $160 on 3 pair of these so I initially saved about $80-$100 total but what's the point when I'm gonna end up spending more to replace them when they fall apart?! I'm disappointed because I anxiously awaited my package for nearly a week and crap is what arrived. If u have never owned Timberland boots before then I suggest u go to an authorized store that sells them so u can at least feel & see what type of boot U should b receiving when ordering online. If u have Timbs then it won't take u but a second to spot these knockoffs. I received the 3 pair that I purchased for my loved ones today and 3 pair r going rite back TODAY!!!!!!! I wasted my time but I WILL NOT waste my money. Dont b like me by ignoring the reviews and buying these anyway. Buyer beware unless u just don't care!!!!!!!"
"I purchased these boots for my grandson. When I received them, they were filthy and showed obvious signs of wear and tear. To say that I was disappointed is an understatement."
The box was torn and not in good condition. The boots although listed as brand new had some white residue on the bottom of the boots. To my surprise I tried the boots on my son today and I was sent two different sizes. What is going on here??
"My son and I love them. We are both a size 5 in boys, and the fit is perfect. Very comfortable."
"These boots are for my grandson. He needed something more sturdy for hiking, etc than regular sneakers. I bought them a little big because they are obviously a stiffer material than sneakers and a little harder to put on. But they are great quality and my grandson says they are comfortable."
"The shipping was super fast and the product came as expectes. I love that I got these classic ""chicken and broccoli"" timbs for such a great buy. I would definately purchase these again"
"Fits a tad small but fine with a thin sock. Very comfortable and excellent support for my feet. Since I've been wearing them for my walking, my feet are in better shape as the shoe properly aligns my foot. With the flared sole they are very stable over ground. Great buy!"
Compra 100% satisfacción. Excelente diseño y calidad. Cómodo y a un precio accesible.Ahora hay que probarlo para ratificar su durabilidad.
Fit like a glove!! Even wear barefoot no problem! Won’t disappoint -fantastic quality as usual
Confort à mes attentes
"I'm an advanced runner, former collegiate track/cross country runner, averaging between 50-60 miles/week, and race 5k up to ultramarathons. I say this just to try to enforce that I like to think I know my running shoes. And I know this review is just my opinion, and that there is a perfect running shoe out there for everyone - this might not be yours, but holy cow, they are mine! I've been wearing Brooks Ghost and Launch for years, then started wearing Hoka Cliftons for long runs and recovery runs when I'm doing more ultra-focused training. I tend to find a shoe that works, then wear it religiously until they change it so much that I need to try something new, or if I get injured and that shoe feels like it has bad juju (slightly superstitious). I was overdue for new shoes, and went to buy the Cliftons but something prompted me to do some research and open my horizons. So I started looking around and came across the New Balance Vongo. I've been wearing neutral shoes for years, so was really hesitant to buy a stability shoe, but read that these are kind of on the neutral-end of stability, if there's such a thing.Anyway, with the <$100 price, I gave it a go because why not. It's now been about 2 months that I've been wearing them for just about every single run, and oh my gosh, I feel like I've hit the mother load. I recently ordered a second pair to have on standby for when my current pair is worn down, and am tempted to stock up on like 100 more pairs just so I know I'll have them for the rest of my life. The sock/knit liner is snug and keeps my foot in place, so I have no rubbing or hot spots. They are SO comfortable, they're like an extension of my foot. The foam is responsive and light so they work just as well for tempo's or interval workouts as they do for long runs. The grip is great and I actually prefer using these for trail runs over my specialty Salomon trail shoes. The only downside of these shoes (literally the ONLY downside) is that rocks seem to get stuck in the tread more often than any of my other running shoes.TLDR: These shoes rock."
I am on my 2nd pair of this style shoe. I love these shoes! I went with the Vongo when NB switched the 1260s to the Rubix. I am a daily runner logging 20-35 miles per week I love the sock fit and everything about this shoe.
"I have never owned New Balance running/walking shoes but these are very comfortable.  I walk approximately 12 miles a week, mostly on pavement and do several 5K's during the year.  They are very light in weight and I really like the tongue.  It is almost like a sock and it doesn't slip down in  your shoe.  Overall,  great price and good fitting shoe.  However, I did buy a size up because I think they run small."
"I don’t know why, but these shoes caused my calves to cramp up BAD. I run 3 miles a day, 5 days a week and when I switched to these shoes, my calves cramped almost the instant I began my run. I do have really muscular calves, and I thought maybe the shoes just needed breaking in, so I wore them all day for several days, but every time I tried running in them, the calf cramps returned. I think it’s just too much of a heel drop for me. I went back to my old worn out shoes and the cramps were gone, so I returned the shoes. My son runs XC and track and wears the men’s version of these and absolutely loves them. He’s on his third pair. I really wanted to love them, but I got the NB Roav instead and they are fabulous. I wouldn’t recommend these Vongos to anyone with large calf muscles."
"The reviews about the comfort of the soles made me buy these--and that they were listed for running and stability. I won't get to try out the soles because the shoes are useless for running etc.I have entirely flat feet with a wide toe box (loose ligaments.)  I need corrective shoes--orthotics aren't enough.  New Balance let me run, but I gotta say, they are moving away from structure and support and overpronation--which is what this shoe was listed mistakenly to address.  It's a sock with no structure on top of a foamy platform.  I'd worry about ankles with the platform height.  The sole won't hold up to track or terrain, or even miles of grass.  Indoor shoes for $164?  So this is New Balance's new Sketchers-not-workout-line of shoes.Sizing was right on.  They look just like the picture--which is a step up from the vinyl models, but just barely."
"I've never tried on a pair of Fresh Foam NB's before.  I read the reviews before buying them and overall, what I anticipated receiving certainly wasn't what I got.  They were the correct shoes and the correct size, but the second I stood up in them the question that immediately popped out of my mouth was, where's the foam?  There's next to no cushioning in these shoes and the instep is very narrow.  Needless to say, they are heading back to the return center tomorrow."
"In general, I haven't found any affordable toddler shoes w better traction than the Merrells on Amazon. My toddler had the M-Trail Chaser Jr.  which he wore whenever we went on dirt/pebble trails (vs. his Nike sneakers ). However, they are heavier than these and I think less breathable because there's less mesh. (See side to side photo. This shoe model is in the foreground. M-Trail Chaser is in back of it). That being said, I think those may be more durable over time and more water resistant as these have more mesh which may tear more easily and let more water in, but we shall see. I also think these are slightly wider and easier to step into than the M-Trail Chasers.They claim these are machine washable which is nice though I would probably just spray them down w a hose.Hopefully you found this review helpful."
"Initially pleased with these shoes, but after only three months they are showing way more wear and tear than they should. Cloth around the top is fraying all around. My biggest concern though is wear metal loop that the start goes through. The loop is failing and looks like it will soon break rendering these shoes worthless.Update 3/2021: Velcro gave out, shoes falling apart, didn't even last a year. Super disappointed!"
"Be aware that the description is incorrect; these are NOT big kid sizes, they are little kid/toddler sizes."
We love these shoes for our girls! They are so sturdy and durable with great grip that makes them perfect for camping and hiking and even bike riding. They hold up so well they never look just destroyed like their other shoes do much more quickly with much less wear. We were excited to finally score a purple pair in the right size. But it’s always their go to shoe for any activity outside.
"Our daughter was jealous of her big sister's light-up shoes, but she needs a little more serious support. Once she got on her ""camper shoes,"" her mind was quickly changed. She says they are comfy and can easily get them on and off. While not as important, I appreciate that they look nice! Would purchase again."
"I printed Merrel's size chart, ordered the widest available. The length was perfect, the opening for the foot is stupidly small. The market for good outdoor shoes for toddlers is such that I really had no other option and chose to keep them. They haven't become any easier, i.e. they've not loosened. Or maybe the toddlers feet are just keeping up with that. Again, great traction on the sole for serious hiking and rough terrain... But they really could improve the ankle fit (maybe this is the width component of the shoe, but whatever it is, I hope buying next year's size isn't as hard as it was this year)."
Disappointed with the quality especially at this high price as the elastic cord came undone literally the first time this shoe was used. We decided to keep it as the shoe still seems to be functional and needed it immediately.Make sure to test the shoes you get before letting the kid wear them.
My 3 star rating might be a little harsh but I have little patience when it comes to frustrating children’s items. The shoes fit and my toddler seems to like them but even after purchasing the wide version they are very difficult to put on. There are plenty of shoes my 3 year old can put on herself but she definitely can’t do these... I barely can.
"I’m generally a lover Merrell shoes. So, of course I buy them for my children as well. I bought these for my son to use them on an extended camping trip (3.5weeks). He has a primary pair of Merrell shoes, and was going to wear these as his backup in case the others got wet. After one day of just walking around a state park (with minimal stress), I noticed that the front sole was coming apart. He wore these for a second day, and the sole was apart for a whole inch. I had to buy super glue. The picture shows the shoes after I glued them. We were still on our long camping trip and my son had to keep wearing the shoes so they are a little broken in now. Besides the sole coming apart at the toe, the shoes were great. This is the first Merrell shoe that I've been disappointed with. My son said that they were comfortable."
"Fits as expected. I bought them in 3.5 Wide size for my child, they were comfy and were gray for hiking in Yosemite. He loves them so much - that he wears them to school sometimes. These shoes really provide good support - for arch support and also helps with not pronating. My son has used these for only two weeks so Dont know how long it will last before the shoes get holes or components fall apart ( thatywhat happens to all his other pairs of shoes - from other big name brand.) Definitely recommend."
Livre exactement à la date par contre pas la bonne couleur
Mio figlio distrugge tutte le scarpe le uniche che reggono sono queste . Buon rapporto qualità prezzo
"Excelentes zapatillas originales de la marca New Balance. El número es perfecto, ni más grande ni más pequeño, es el número que habitualmente calza.  Rápida entrega y perfectamente embalado. Muy recomendable"
"El envio ha llegado en menos de 24hrs. Repetimos modelo, aunq 1 talla mas, así que hemos ido a lo seguro, porque nos gusta la forma y la ergonimía para un niño de 3 años."
Diseño muy bonito.Pero a mi hijo le han durado menos de un mes.No son zapatillas de deporte fuertes.No esperaba tan mala calidad de una marca así.
Sono stupende!! abbinabili con qualsiasi colore
Calzatura nuova in perfette condizioni
Stupende e comode
"Comodissimo  , gusto per il bambino."
Bonitos pero demasiado grandes
Schuh geht super zu reinigen. Passt auch sehr gut
Desde que descubrí la marca he comprado varios pares y todos han sido excelentes.
fun and comfortable slip on shoe
"It looked premium when received. However once my daughter started using it, some of the part started degrading faster than expected. Not expected with 4K plus costing shoes"
"Amazing lightweight shoes,makes u feel like floating on clouds.fit for broad feet,liked it thoroughly."
very nice true to the size.I have wide feet and it's fits me well
Not sure if it can be used for running . Sole is too high
"Llegó a tiempo mi pedido, están súper cómodos y los encontré a un súper precio."
"Great shoe for a great price,I really loved it,comfortable and well cushioned"
Size not. Perfectly fit
Not as good as expected
"Bought these for running and had them for two weeks, before buying another pair just for work.  These are the most comfortable shoes I have had in quite a while.  I have flat feet and suffer from plantar faciisitis; I have a really hard time finding shoes that are soft enough to run in, as well as, stand in for 12+ hrs.  These shoes are great and the cushions and treads seems to be lasting very well.  For the running shoes, I have reached about 250 miles and my tread pattern matches my other shoes at this point. So I'm sure I will easily be able to get 400 miles out of them before needing a replacement pair.  For the work pair, I stand for 12+ hrs, and by the end of my shift I surprisingly have no pain anywhere in my feet or ankles.  It is incredible because usually I buy shoes and by the end of the I am in excruciating pain because of my plantar faciisitis.  I highly recommend these shoes for people with foot pain."
I do a lot of power walking and my feet never hurt in these shoes.  I need a lot of padding in order to be comfortable since I have pain in the ball of my foot and I wear customer orthotics.  These shoes are great!  I highly recommend them and would buy again.
Fits my daughter and is comfortable. Good combo of casual and comfortable.
"Están muy bonitos, son a la talla por lo que llego el número que esperaba, solo tengan en cuenta que si el pie de su pequeño es gordito no le quedará y pidan un número extra ya que son muy angostos."
Should be advertised as narrow they are not wide
We’ve had these shoes maybe 2 weeks. My daughter has worn them maybe 4 times. Already the strap felt apart and the fabric stitching on the shoe itself ripping. We usually love new balance. What a disappointment :(
"I don’t feel like this shoe was designed to fit an actual foot. The Velcro strap is positioned in such a way it would only fit a totally flat foot. Since my daughter has a regularly shaped foot, the strap cuts in on the top of her arch at an odd and uncomfortable angle. Are these actually made by New Balance? The shoes are very cute and would have been  outgrown quickly anyway, so not worth the hassle of return, but very confused why new balance would create a shoe like this. (Sizing was TTS and the purple and green combo is adorable.)"
"These make my 8 year old daughter run much faster and able to jump much higher. They are super comfortable and have amazing traction for beating her big brother at sports. He doesn't stand a chance against these sneakers.Mom loves them too, they don't look dirty after trekking through dirt, wear well, and accommodate a wider toe structure...aka duck shaped feet."
Daughter LOVES these. She had picked them out at Macy’s and for whatever reason we didn’t want to carry stuff with us and ordered them off amazon and so happy we did! Daughter is 7 almost 8 and got her the size 2 to grow into. She loves them and didn’t want to take them off despite there being room for her to grow. Colors are awesome. Exactly as pictured. Ours are the black with red stripe up the heel and lemon-lime bottoms. Happy
"Very nice NB for my 6 year old boy.  He is not a fan of putting shoes on, especially if they take some work to get on and off.  But, these are very easy for him to get on and Velcro.  Also, they are very nice quality.  We have had a few different NB shoes, and these are just nicer / the N is raised plastic v. Just printed, nice laces and strap, etc.  well worth the money!"
"New Balance tends to run a little wider in the foot, but not these. The opening to the shoe is very small so despite trying to make it as broad as possible, my daughter couldn’t get her foot into the shoe. It was the right size otherwise! Disappointed it wasn’t as easy to slip on as advertised. Her foot is a typical width, but we always like to buy slightly wider. Super cute shoe, well made and nice color- just not a slip on and go sneakers."
These are such nice quality and the colors are exactly as pictured. Fit is as expected and my son lives in them! Will purchase again!
Bought these shoes for my 3 year old boy and they are so nice! So easy for him to put on and they are great quality and look so nice on him.
"I am satisfied with how it fit my feet. Im a size 5 and my feet are so skinny I could fit on kids sizes. I like how it has support on the arch but the only disappointing part is that the footbed (sole) wasn't glued flat on one of the shoe, I could feel the fold as I walk, I can get use to it or even fix it myself but  I hope future products would be inspected properly prior to shipping. Otherwise, I still love it and I won't return it. :)"
サイズがピッタリで履き心地が良いです。外反母趾が酷いので､履ける靴が限定されますが､此方の商品は指先に当たる事もなく履き心地が良いです。
とても歩きやすく疲れない
最初足を通した時にキツく感じましたがベルトを緩めたらすんなり入ってホッとしました。ベルトを調節して履いたらつま先からかかとまでフィットして歩きやすかったです。
"Purchased these for a brief trip to Europe (because I wanted something comfortable) and have already worn them. No need to break them in, however, and I look forward to wearing them in Croatia, France, and Germany. They are not sexy, but then neither am I!"
"My partner HATES Chaco sandals because they get dirty and so do the feet in them so these were a great compromise! I wear size 6 in all open toed sandals (6.5 in all tennis shoes), ordered these in size 6 and they fit great. Plenty of room in the toe box, no squishing of the toes. The arch is something to get used to, seems a little different the the Chaco sandals but it isn’t uncomfortable.  I wear these when I take the dogs for walks and wore them in Hawaii when my feet got tired of my other flip flops.  Only thing is rocks and gravel get in pretty easily. Other than that, they are great!"
"My 66 year old flat feet require and adore the substantial arch support that Chaco is famous for. I was looking for a water shoe and tried the Chaco Outcross Evo but the arch support was strangely lacking. Next stop the Chaco Odyssey Sport...ding, ding, ding! Winner! Great toe protection for river walking...sometimes you gotta pull that kayak...and very attractive to boot. Super comfy and fits like a dream. I was concerned that the closed toe might be too tight for my usual size 5 in Chaco open sandals so I sized up to a 6 but that was too big. Returned that and ordered the 5...perfect fit and plenty of room for my arthritic toes and bunions in the roomy toe box. Highly recommended for flat feet, high arches and foot problems like Plantar fasciitis. BTW, for anyone annoyed by the long straps which are a classic Chaco feature enabling custom fit, the long end is easy to tuck between the elastic and the fabric at the back heel with no heel rubbing."
I have a pair of the Chaco’s sandals but they dont really compare. The rubber footbed felt softer and a more flexible footbed. I have wide feet but they felt try to size. I also didn’t have the issue with a ridiculously long strap that others described. They also felt different in the arch support. It was a little strange at first but was just fine. No break in period was needed. My wife loved hers so much I got a pair too! Overall they are great shoes for any activity
I love these shoes. I’m on my feet all day doing physical therapy and my feet feel so good! Great investment
Very similar to another Chaco sandals. They hit it out of the park with this closed toe sandal! As a medical professional it's important to have comfy shoes at work. Thankful these work for me! The only down side is sweaty feet but other than that they're amazing!
"Il modello è molto carino, ma ahimè si rovina facilmente, la suola infatti si è in molte parti consumata ed è diventata quasi nera, anche se alla mia bimba le ho messe solo in occasioni particolari e non tutti i giorni."
"even after being worn a few times, they are so narrow that they hurt feet -wouldn't recommend"
Chaussures de qualité à petit prix
"The picture and description were misleading.The picture is shown as white but the description says black. Very upsetting, I won’t be buying shoes from here anymore."
Mi pedido fue unos conversé blanco y me llegaron negro
"My daughter really loves these shoes. They are very light and breathable. She really likes that she can put them on and off all on her own. They appear to be well made and are so affordable.*Update - I had to order a second pair in a larger size because my daughter has outgrown the first pair and still loves to wear these shoes to school everyday, and she's super picky about her clothes and shoes.Also, the first pair is still in good condition and has held up to machine washing very well. I will be keeping them for my son when he grows into this size because since we chose to go with the grey shoe it's gender neutral."
"The shoes on initial inspection are a very vibrant, exciting and electrictrifying blue color. They are extremely lightweight yet durable and well made (made in China for those with a need to know) and the velcro strap isnt the typical short barely reaching the other side length. These straps have an amazing reach from one side to the other. I purchased a size 13 for my sons 1st day of school. He doesn't know how to tie shoes yet and doesn't really have the dexterity for it and these appear to be exactly what I need. Better quality than I've seen in most brick-and-mortar shoe stores. You won't be disappointed!"
"I got my son the 'full black-3' style and he LOVES them.  He is 5 and autistic and rarely stops moving.  Initially for them just as play shoes.  I get him multiple pair of Nikes each year for school, but he prefers these to any of the Nikes and asks to wear them all the time.  They're made well and still look new through months of running, jumping, mud, falling, kicking.  Will be ordering more."
"Great for messing around outside in the dirt and muck. However, the soles of of shoes are not rubber. So on hardwood floors, they slide really bad. On playground equipment, the slide really bad. These are my go to shoes for both my kids for outdoor messy play when I don't want to ruin their good shoes. Nice and wide. But ya, the basically cloth bottoms make it hard to give these shoes a lot of stars."
"These little sneakers are the best. I am so glad I discovered them shortly after my son started walking. He is 2.5 now and we've been through about 3 sizes and I will keep re-ordering until he can no longer wear this brand. The quality is great (they have held up better than the Adidas and Nike $40+ sneakers I have bought in the past) and they look adorable on. He loves these shoes and picks them out over anything else. I bought the black/grey pair and the blue/navy pair and they match everything. Definitely don't hesitate to purchase. From a sizing perspective, I think they do run SLIGHTLY on the small side. He is still wearing an 8 in See Kai Run but wears a 9 in these."
The soles of the shoes seem to last a little while but the fabric and elastic on these do not hold up for long at all for my rough player. He is 7 and within a month of wearing these I was already noticing the fabric fraying. By the 3rd month I ended up just throwing them away. So I think they're decent if your child isn't rough on shoes but if they are then don't even bother buying.
"After spending $60 a pair for striderite and saucony which were unwearable, I took a chance on these. Great looking, mom loves them, super comfortable, grandson loves them, bought several pairs, father happy because shoes get lost."
Very good looking shoes.  My daughter loves them.  They are true to size.  The Light up stars are bright.  I Got exactly what I expected.  I am very happy with this purchase.
I bought two pairs for my 3 year olds. They are super cute and great quality! Not a “cheapy” toddler shoe like most seem to be.
"These are very cute, but fell apart before she grew out of them. The stitching ripped within 4 months. Very disappointed for the price paid.  However, the customer service is exceptional, I received a partial refund. It is hard to find such good customer service."
I purchased them for my husband who had a difficult time in finding his size but luckily I was able to save the day.
Love these great quality
No es igual a lo que venden según las imágenes del producto. Deforme. Ni la cantidad de agujeros para pasar el cordón coinciden 🥴
Great!!
Great gift for my niece.
"Am Anfang war ich sehr begeistert von diesen Schuhen. Leider hat sich die Begeisterung gelegt: kurze Strecken (z.B. als Hausschuh) sind voll ok, aber sobald man etwas schneller werden möchte, rutscht man äusserst ungünstig innerhalb des Schuhs herum, durch die fehlende Fersenkappe kann man den Schuh sogar verlieren, falls es noch schneller werden sollte. Leider daher nur als Hausschuh empfehlenswert, als Straßenschuh untauglich."
"Pedido enviado muy bien protegido, las bambas con una horma de plástico duro interior para que no se deformen, muy bien guardadas, son muy cómodas, y el número perfecto, uso un 45+46, pedí el 45 y clavadas, perfectas..se ven de buenas calidad y acabados.."
"Die Sabot passen perfect, sind schön fest und trotzdem leicht. Ich laufe sehr gut mit ihnen und sie sind sehr bequem. Habe mittlerweile 2 Paar davon."
"Toller Schuh, habe ihn auf gut Glück in Gr. 41 gekauft, in der Hoffnung, das er passt. Habe eigentlich Gr. 40. Leider war er viel zu groß. Würde mich freuen, wenn es ihn irgendwann in Gr. 40 gibt, dann bin ich sofort dabei. Rücksendung ging wie immer problemlos"
"Sehr gute Tretter, ziehe sie jeden Tag an, passgröße perfekt, ebenso der halt und rutschsicher bei Feuchtigkeit sind sie auch, was will man mehr bei diesem Preis"
"Super schöne Schuhe, für diesen Preis, bin mehr als begeistert. Einzig bei der Größe muss man aufpassen, 43 fällt aus wie 44-45. Musste sie deshalb nochmal umtauschen und hab jetzt eine Nummer kleiner bestellt."
trag die gerne .. habe schon die 2.
sind soweit ok und der Geruch verschwindet auch nach ein paar Tagen
Leider sehr weit
Passte leider nich zu meinen Füßen. Es ist dennoch ein schöner Schuh.
Kleber hält nicht schlechte Ware wir bitten immernoch um Geldzurück oder ein retouren schein !!!!!!!!!!warum wird nicht geantwortet
"Hay que coger más talla. En todas mis Adidas tengo un 42 2/3 y en estas un 44. Por lo demás es lo esperado en una NMD, cómoda y funcional."
Schlechte Qualität bestimmt nicht Orginal
Er fällt leider etwas klein aus

"Super Schuhe, gute Qualität"
Super schöne und bequeme Schuhe. Top Qualität und Verarbeitung.
Leider waren die Schuhe zu klein. Ich habe peranchreiben zurück geschickt. Jetz habe ich Rechnung von Firma paigo bekommen. Ich bitte Sie um das Fehler zu beheben.
Me encanta  su calidad y comodidad.
Diese gut Schuh🤣👌
"Bought these for my daughter to play with her travel indoor soccer team. Great fit, very durable and comfortable. They look cool too. They showed up early."
These shoes are great but the run a half size too large so order down a half size.
Fits perfect. Good turf shoe. My daughter loves them.
"fit as expected,my kid loves them"
Kiddo likes them
Fits my son perfectly. Comfortable from day 1.
Beautiful sneakers
these shoes fit perfectly and are great for both indoor and turf
Fantastic shoes for indoor soccer!  My son loves them!
my nephew love the shoes the color is like the picture and they fit perfect.
Sie sind super bequem und auch super leicht vom Gewicht. Angenehmes laufen und die Größe passt wie erwartet.
😃

So comfortable and durable! The shoe it’s self is a little heavy so not ideal for running but I wear them bartending/serving and they’re great for that!
"They’re confortable and nice looking. However, with even light rain your feet get soaked"
"Show size was true, they fit perfectly. They are also comfortable."
Great seller. Had a little shipping snafu but they took care of it!  Highly recommend.
Great shoe. I wish that I had found earlier.
I love the style and fit of the sneakers
"I disliked the pricing, why does it cost $54.95 for a size 11 and $64.95 for a size 10.5"
Quality Shoe and really light. Good feel on the foot. Good shoe for just casual wear.
Little big. I wear them to lift weights. Comfortable though
Great shoe super comfortable
"Belle, comode e spero anche resistenti(le abbiamo da pochissimo).Il numero corrisponde.Venditore disponibile e cordiale.Spedizione Amazon impeccabile."
"Correspond bien à la description, elles sont très jolies. Achetées pour mon fils, il est ravi."
"I debated these shoes and read so many reviews before I spent the money on them. I was planning a trip to Niagara Falls and knew I’d be getting wet and didn’t want to walk around with wet shoes all day. After reading so many mixed reviews — one bad, then good, then bad, etc — I have to say I can’t believe someone would write a bad review of these shoes. I’m not saying they’re perfect but you can’t beat these shoes for the money.Pros:They dry out quickly, they’re vented and they drain water, they’re stylish and they’re comfortable. I walked around NY all day in these and they were great. Are they as comfortable as my other running shoes? No but that’s not why I bought them. I bought them so they’d dry out quickly and they did. Everyone else’s shoes were still wet the next day. Mine were dry in a few hours and I didn’t put them in the sun  or anything like that. Just took them off when we got back to our room. They offered great traction while walking the wooden steps of Niagara Falls as I got drenched!Cons:They’re wide up front in the toe box which I LOVE because I have issues w my right foot and need extra room up front and these were perfect. Also, I didn’t tie these shoes once after initially tying them. They were plenty comfy right out of the box. However I read reviews of people saying they were slipping off their feet?! Did they not tie them?! Not saying someone else’s experience isn’t valid but I’m confused how this would happen. I can’t imagine tying these, let alone tying them tightly, and having them slip off your feet.And sure they’re not as comfortable as a more cushioned running shoe but these are WAY comfy for being vented water shoes. And you can always buy a cushioned sole to make them comfier.I’ve only had them for a few days but they were great for my trip and the traction was great on and off the walking tours we did. I like them so much they’re now an everyday shoe for me. We will see how they hold up in the long run but so far I’m very pleased with this purchase. Would buy again."
"I was skeptical when buying these shoes. I use them for fishing while I'm on the boat. If I'm by myself, walk into the water to launch and recover my boat. They have drain holes in the soles, so you don't keep squishing around in them. Perfect for what I use them for! Plus they breath well while my feet are baking in the sun on the boat."
"I’m a religious buyer of Adidas so when I saw these I had to have them for the summer. Why I found is they aren’t as floppy as they look in the photo, so that’s a good thing, but the sizing was slightly off. I’ve been a size 12 since I was 14 years old and that hasn’t wavered, but I needed to return the 12 for a 12.5 as my toes were cramped up against the front of the shoe. The 12.5 fit great and I’m looking forward to getting in the water with these."
Excelente
Bastante  cómodos .
It took close to two weeks for these to be delivered. Now I can't return them? I should be allowed more time to be able to return these as they did not work and were delivered much later than they should have been.
I think I got used shoes it looks like they are full of sand
Very comfortable for me. Great in warm weather prob due to the drain holes. Great when wet too.
"Verdaderamente hermosos y cómodos, de todo mi gusto."
Runs a little small
"Perfect fit.very comfortable.gorgeous.fashion sneakers or every day running, you decide! True to size"
Unless you play for the LA Lakers or LSU Tigers it is hard to find this color scheme in the marketplace. Adidas did an awesome job with these sneakers and I am glad I got my pair while they are available. Get yours today while they are available!
Fits great and very comfortable.  These are my second pairs.
Great quality just didn’t fit my style looks different than the picture
I like the shoe.  Fits as designed.
Good
"I've always bought my 6 1/2 sneakers and they stayed right in the foot, but this stayed a bit big. And I really liked the teni, very nice and comfortable and I would have given her 5 star, but she was not very loyal to size so I gave her 4 star"
Para el trabajo.
"These shoes were purchased for my boyfriend to wear when coaching football.  He said they were very comfortable, especially when standing for hours at a time for games."
La medida es excelente muy buena calidad
"Je porte du 8 et j'ai toujours chaussé du 8 avec Merrell .Malheureusement il était trop grand , j'ai donc retourné pour un 7.5 ..L'échange a été simple facile et rapide . La premièrer fois que j'ai mis les  7.5 j'avais l'impression que une chausse était trop petite .Mais la chose c est rapidement placé et elles sont très comfortables .La seul chose le tissus attire la saleté et la poussière ..Je dois les brosser régulièrement pour enlever la poussière et autres résidus .Vélcro a saleté !Mais hyper comfortable a porter à l intérieur!"
"I usually fit a size 6 in my footwear, but the size 6 would've cost a hefty hundred dollars or so more to ship to my area than the 5.5. I loved the cute colors on this sneaker so I decided to take the risk.The shoe is absolutely true to the pictures, and the colors just as beautiful and vibrant as they look on my monitor. There is a bit of stretch to the sneaker so the half size down didn't hinder me, though I would still say they're true to size and I will probably end up wearing these sneakers out a bit faster for buying smaller. If you're able, I'd recommend buying your regular foot size still.That said, I absolutely adore these. So cute! They seem to have decent cushioning/support, comfortable, though I've been saving wearing them  for an upcoming trip, so I can't comment on long term durability. Either way, well worth the 30 or so dollars I paid (don't recall exact pricing). Think they'd be great for day to day, walking/running, and general exercise/work out."
"Shoe can get kinda sweaty but, I think this is more of a reflection of my work place. Easy to put on and off. Arch support is great. I really like the shoes.UPDATE: I think I'd reorder this a 1/2 size down. Feels a bit big now."
Received the wrong size of product. Disappointed with customer service on issue considering I checked size 3 times in buying process to insure I get product I need. The issue was not fixed I was recommended to get off brand cheap knock off or pay over 4x the original price I bought these merrell shoes at. I love merrell shoes for my bad ankles but I am disappointed with the customer service
I was so happy when I saw Merrell now made a slip on style of running shoe! They are good quality and super comfortable.  I did find they fit a bit smaller but that was ok.  I will definitely purchase another pair!
"A reliable brand, well made and consistent fit. Can't ask for more."
"I really love these shoes - they are comfortable and hold onto the foot well.  I can walk for miles in them and they are cushioned, and told to my foot beautifully.  So happy with these shoes."
These are extremely comfortable and I am tempted to buy another pair in a different colour.  Have always liked Merrell.
"Parfait pour le prix, wow"
Love these shoes I'm on my feet 12 hour
Its nice to my feet and very light..i like it..
"Like the appearance, weight, fit and wear.  Needed more warmth this winter and the leather does that without making by feet to hot.  Nice boots ."
"Get these shoes a month ago, I've always loved eccos and their quality. These are just as comfortable as any other eccos, however the stitching on mine doesn't look like it got enough suede to hold it together and she pulled loose:("
"Fits great, comfortable, and very stylish.  My husband loves these!"
Ecco products are well made. I have a couple of pair of their shoes. Got them at a very good price. Very happy.
These boots are made from soft leather and the soles are super comfortable.  Can't say enough good about Ecco shoes.  This is a classic looking boot with comfort like you've been wearing them for years.
"Very attractive casual shoe that is ""light weight"" on the feet."
Perfect flit and comfortable.
Great look and very comfortable. ECCO never disappointed me
"Ziemlich bequem aber nach mehreren Stunden treten Schmerzen auf, komischerweise nur rechts"
All around great shoe. Echo lives up to their reputation once again.
"think schuhe, gut wie immer. Bestellung und Ware gut"
"Da ich Probleme mit meinen Füßen hatte habe ich bisher immer Einlagen in den Schuhen getragen.Dann sagte mir ein Schumacher probieren Sie es doch einmal mit Bär Schuhen , diese sind extrem breit und bequem geschnitten.Gesagt getan, seither immer bär Schuhe getragen.Allerdings für festliche Anlässe kein schöner Schuh für einen Anzug dabei.Nun habe ich aufgrund der Bewertungen diesen Schuh gekauft.War sehr erstaunt,schön breit geschnitten und genügend Platz auch für einen breiten Fuß.Daher kann ich diesen Schuh absolut empfehlen.Material und Paßform bestens."
"Ich habe mir bereits das dritte Paar dieses Schuhs gekauft ( einmal mit Ledersohle, zweimal mit Latexsohle) und bin immer noch sehr zufrieden mit diesem. Auch bei Täglichem Tragen hatder Schuh bei mir ca. 3 Jahre gehalten ehe ich ihn ersetzten musste( in der Zeit habe ich einmal den Absatz ersetzten lassen). Das Material ist erstaunlich Robust und die Verarbeitung ist hervorrangend.Ich bin immer noch begeistert von diesen Schuhen.Der Hauptgrund warum ich exakt diesen Schuh so mag ist, dass er sehr breit ist und sich schnell an den Fuß anpasst. Ich habe kaum einen anderen Schuh gefunden der vorne so breit geschnitten ist. Hier bedeutet Extraweit wirklich Extraweit. Für Männer mit breiten Füßen eine gute Wahl."
"Scarpe buone ad un prezzo contenuto. Io le uso solamente in occasioni speciali (feste, matrimoni, battesimi ecc.) quindi non usandole molto non posso dare una valutazione sull'usura. Esteticamente però sono molto belle e la comodità è ottima. Consigliate."
"Très bonne qualité, malheureusement je les ai renvoyé car elles taillent beaucoup trop grand."
"Die Schuhe sieht sehr schön aus und ist auch sehr bequem, leider nach ein paar Wochen ging an der Spitze die Leder weg."
These are so comfortable for around the house! REocmmend +++
just not as comfortable as they should be
Ils sont fait grand. Très confortable.
These hydro mocs are great just kickin around the house though I have taken them outside a few times. Love em .Will buy again.
"I wear a size 10.5 running shoe, and since I read previous reviews about this shoe being too big, I ordered a size 10.  The size 10 was very comfortable, and I love the arch support and walking on rough terrain.  But when wet from kayaking, my feet would slip and slide in them.  So I am going to wear these shoes on dry land or around the house, but ordered and received another pair in a size 9.  The size 9 fit tight enough, they won't slip and slide while my feet are wet."
"I love the shoe. However, there needs to be some more transparent disclosure on sizing. On Amazon, they make it appear that this shoe comes in half-sizes. It does not. I read in reviews that these run large, and sizing down is a good idea. I am an 8.5 medium, so ordered size 8. HUGE. Turns out when I ordered an 8.5, it was an 8, and I needed to downsize to a 7. I like the shoe, so am exchanging to a 7. If you are between sizes, order 1.5 size down. Know that if you order an 8.5, you are ordering Merrill size 8, which is a whole size too big."
Love these! Absolutely better fit than crocs but I sized a size down. I usually wear a 9 but I ordered an 8 and it fits perfectly. Soooooo comfy!
"Wanted shoes that I could slip on, slog around in my garden and wash off with the hose when done.  These work great for that purpose. Was confident  in trying these as I've purchased Merrells before and have always been pleased with their fit.  quality and comfort."
"I love these shoes. I have worn them for kayaking and tubing. Had to get on and off the tube several times in the water and the support, protection and grip was great on the large rocks. I also like the ventilation holes. It can get hot while tubing and I could dip my feet in the water and cook them off.My foot is very narrow and these run really wide. I had to go a size down so they wouldn’t slide off my feet while walking."
"Had my husband get these for me. We both love Merrill’s and when I received the mailer I jumped at these. I can’t wear the other brands because they don’t have support or a back on the heel. I need the back because I have Achilles heel and need a wedge in my heel. We have a large creek on our property that we wade and cast for trout, and these are PERFECT!!  I like they don’t have the big bumps on the soul on the inside and fit well. I’ll wear them all summer with shorts too!!"
Qualität gut
Scarpe stupende e colore strepitoso. Sono leggerissime. Una scarpa pesa 194 grammi. Casual ma davvero chic. Tra le tante questo è uno dei modelli più belli (VOLGO)
"De excelente calidad, muy MUY cómodos y no lastiman el talón si los usas sin calcetines. Puedes ponértelos y quitártelos fácilmente (ideales para la pandemia)."
"Prime skechers comprate, sembra di stare in pantofole.Comodissime, leggere e avvolgenti, ci a maineresti per km senza stancarti.Consigliatissime"
"Después de usarlos un par de días sin calcetines, son muy cómodos y quedan muy bien. Si buscamos alguna pega, que no transpiran mucho, por lo que los pies se calientan un poco. Yo los usé con polvos anti-transpirantes para evitar el sudor."
Zapatos tipo náuticos muy cómodos. El número 40 es el que uso habitualmente y me va como un guante. Son ligeros y para pasear de manera tranquila vienen muy bien
"Ein schöner und leichter Schuh, den ich gerne und oft trage, qualitativ super,  bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Produkt"
"muy suaves, cómodos y se ven muy bien!!! los recomiendo mucho..."
Caja contenedora completamente destrozada!! Parecían que venían de un rastrillo. No va con la imagen de Amazon. Estas cosas hay que cuidarlas. No se puede enviar cualquier cosa.
"Son bastante caros, aunque por el momento cómodos. Tienen poco uso espero duren así de cómodos."
"Producto exacto al descrito, envío súper rápido (tardó solo 3 días en llegar a Canarias). Son originales, trae el memory foam y tallan como cualquier otra Skechers. Vendedor100% recomendable."
"My foot is a 9Wide in everything I wear. I even own some other Cole Haan shoes that are a 9Wide that fit, though those are dress shoes. With this sneaker, just looking at it tells you that the wide isn't really a wide. I own many pairs of Nike 9Wide shoes that all fit...and if anything, they're on the slightly too large side. I thought I would give these shoes a try since they looked cool. Unfortunately, they are a fail when it comes to producing a wide sneaker, so back they go. Too bad because they are a nice looking shoe, both inside and out."
"Son muy cómodos, livianos y frescos."
"Passt sehr gut, obwohl wir normal 37 brauchen. Sehr gut verarbeitet und gute Qualität. Halten bei den jetzigen -15 Grad schön warm."
Diese Schuhe sind ihr Geld nicht wert. Nach nicht ganz 8 Wochen ist schon der erste Reisverschluss kaputt.Schrottware. Bloß nicht kaufen!!
Leider zu klein.Aber gutes Produkt
Sehr sehr hochwertig aus!! Schuhlänge passt super - ist aber sehr schmal geschnitten ...
"I bought this when my kid was 2 so the size was too big but she wore them no problem and loved it. She loved doing the velcro herself. Now my kid is 3 and she still likes wearing them, it's overused now but it's still comfortable. This is her go-to shoes for everything ( biking, hiking, beach, walking, playing )."
Awesome comfy little shoes for my little guy. Very lightweight. Great price here verses overpriced at Footlocker!
"Me gusto el diseñoLa durabilidad no es tan buena, en este caso lo usa un niño pero ya tiene su primer rasgadura, sin embargo pues hablando de niños puede que sea lo normal."
"Son muy bonitos pero vienen las tallas inexactas, lo bueno es que la devolución fue sin problemas y rápida"
"The toddler I bought them for has wide feet. I thought that the elastic might be enough to make them fit. If you are looking for a shoe that fits wide, this is not the shoe for you. I would say they would be good for a ""normal"" foot. Otherwise, they appear to be a good shoe, very stylish, flat sole for stability."
"exactly what i need, perfect fit, simple runners."
Bought a toddler 9 and it fits exactly as expected. Great colour and comfortable for a wide-ish foot.
I ordered these sneakers for my 2 1/2 year toddler. They fit well and look cool!
Easy to get on. Nice and neutral. A little large in size but the Velcro sexuée foot in place. Seem durable.
These are amazing - i wish i could buy in my size haha
"These are the second pair of shoes I have purchased from the Allonsi brand and believe I have become a loyal customer of theirs now. I received many compliments on the previous and decided to purchase their new range when these came out.These shoes are extremely stylish and very comfortable. It also fit true to size which is something i have not found to be common in the US. Extra care was taken with the packaging and boxing which I appreciate and the seller was very responsive to questions I had prior to purchase.I know that many of us find ourselves in a remote working environment and as such, there is not a defined dress code for shoes (since no one sees your shoes in a zoom meeting), but honestly, it really felt good to just get something stylish for myself again and felt good in wearing these.Highly recommended :-)"
"Un bel paio di scarpe, non c'è che dire. Non ho dato 5 stelle per un unico ""problema"", se così vogliamo definirlo: le suole sono dotate di tanti piccoli incavi che garantiscono una buona aderenza anche su superfici lucide. Però questi incavi, camminando su piastrelle o superfici in linoleum, causano un fastidioso ""effetto ventosa"" che si ripete, rumorosamente, ad ogni passo."
"After reading all the reviews I was convinced to spend $160 on this sexy pair of shoes. I wasn't sure whether to buy 12 (my size) or 13 as I have the flattest widest feet.  All the reviews said the shoes fit true to size but I went with my gut and sized up because the sleek cut of the shoe and did not regret it. It fit exactly as I expected, comfortable without squeezing my toes and with a little gap between my toes and the front of the shoe. The most expensive pair of shoes I own by far but well worth the price."
Veramente comodo... misura giusta
Not as described! Obvious defect in the leather that was used to “craft” this boot.
I was anti-chelsea boots for a long time because I didn't think they would look right on my slim legs but these changed my mind all the way around. I loved the quality and fit compared to a few box retail stores that I tried out. The real leather and the way the shine is unmatched. Looking down when wearing them and seeing the quality still showing after weeks of wearing lets me know for sure I made the right purchase. I'm a photographer so it's the perfect boot for me to photograph in as well.
The price is great and they look good.
"I simply love this boot!I immediately could tell the quality, which is a big deal for me. They are also very comfortable to wear as well.I will be purchasing another pair in a different color to add to my collection."
I liked these boots because they were really high quality for the price. They have a great welt and the leather also looks good. Didn't need a lot of time to break them in. The color is also great I got them in brown and I wear them alot. I cant wait to see how they look in a year!
Fits perfectly and great quality. Seems like it would cost much more considering the craftsmanship. Very happy with this purchase.
"Impressive packaging, the boots are extremely comfortable and the fit was perfect! Love them!!Highly recommend them, maybe even two pair!"
"WOW!!! I love these shoes. The fit perfectly, they are comfy, AND super stylish. When the pandemic is over, I cannot wait until I can wear these out. 10/10 recommend. Plus, the packaging is really fun to open."
"Beautiful sneakers. I like the color, fit, all leather. I am a woman and bought these at men's department because my size is 42. But they are unisex"
I got these Runners in 2 days they  fit amazing & comfortable.  and great price
"El mejor par de reebok que he tenido, va justo al pie, asi que si tienes pie ancho en los dedos pide medio numero mas. Son comodos para caminar o estar de pie en largas jornadas, se deben limpiar con cuidado por la gamuza."
She was very very comfortable looks like the picture
"My husband wore these around the house 5 minutes after using them as a nightlight for two weeks. Yes these shoes in the color Pantone are just that bright. He says the shoes are the correct size. The fit is so poor his heel comes out with each step.Not actual leather. These shoes are nothing like the so called original Reebok. There is a material allowed to be called leather that is polyurethane attached to leather, allegedly leather, that I think is a ""leather"" constructed from dandruff scales removed with all the success of fracking."
I really dislike when companies combine sizes for kids.  I bought the 13-1 size for my daughter who is almost a 1.5.  But the next size was a 2-3.  Luckily these fit her and she finds them very comfortable. The memory foam and non-slip bottoms are a bonus.
I ordered these shoes one half size larger than my normal size. It was recommended by several reviewers. They are a perfect fit and comfortable. I immediately bought another pair to put away. I play tennis in them and wear out shoes in less than a  year. Expensive shoes don't last longer either. I have not had good luck buying shoes on Amazon but I am very pleased with these. I thought about buying two extra pair but at age 70 that might be too optimistic.
I love them for my 4 year old daughter. She picked them out and they are easy for her to put on . No running in them your child can slip but they still have the hard bottom. And they're very soft and my daughter stated that she feels like she's walking on a cloud lol. So I'm assuming the memory foam works lol.
"Comfortable, colorful, fun shoe!  After 56 years of buying strictly white sneakers, I really had to think out of the box for this purchase.  Fortunately, I did, and I love my new, blue shoes!!!  Realistically, I purchased these shoes for better comfort when walking.  I'm an avid walker, and my most recent walking shoes have not been a great fit for walking.  Plus, they were falling into poor condition.  Naturally, my first objective was comfortable shoes for walking.  However, when I found these colorful, retro blue shoes, I couldn't resist.  I've never owned a pair of shoes anywhere near the color of my purchase, but I'm so proud of them!  They look and feel great!!  Of course, in the beginning, as with all shoes, you must ""break"" them in.  The more you wear them, the more the comfort increases.  I have been walking in mine for about three weeks, and they're just now starting to offer the comfort and support I expect.  The look and color get immediate attention.  The first time out of the house , my good friend immediately noticed and was complimentary!  I have a weekly walking group on Tuesday night, and the first time I  wore these shoes, every person noticed and made favorable comments.  The bottom line;  nice, comfortable, colorful, fun shoe!!  Great for walking!!"
Purchased these for my 7 year old as she’d outgrown her other slippers. She loves the cozy material and the sweet heart detail.
"The chalk color sneaker is NOT leather, so three stars for that. It is a thin fabric. The shoe is on the narrow side (I have medium wide feet)  but fits comfortably. I agree with another reviewer that cushioning is lacking but I solved this with gel soles from the drugstore. Overall the shoe is perfect at this price for casual walking or standing for a good amount of time. The color is nice.The black pair may be leather. I can’t really tell, but the tab at the back of the shoe, which feels like leather, is not the same texture as the rest of the shoe. It fits the same. Overall a good purchase."
They were a little bit big but I just wear them like slippers with no back
Love these..great looking for sure BUT the material wears off from water/normal maintenance (no chemicals used to wash) you’d do on a shoe. I have two extremely lightly worn pairs that I got about 3 months ago now. The first I made mistakes on so got a second pair..found the mistakes were more or less unavoidable. Why I rate these low has nothing actually do to with the shoe or the wear...I rate them low because I bought these for $29 dollars the first time and $32 the second! There no way they are worth $75 even with low supply! That’s more than double for a shoe that wears easy! Don’t do it! Look great but not for that price unless you buying them for a fit or just a Single occasion!
"So cute and super gold hahah! More like a faint prism gold. Not a flat gold. It’s little shinier than I expected. You definitely would be seen a mile away. I love them. However, I had to return them because they are little too short for my toes.  I have narrow, long toed feet lol.  I am usually a 7.5...The left shoe has a red sole and it has the Wonder Woman 1984 printed . The right is blue inside the sole. Too cute. Metallic gold laces.Also, it’s packaged in a sweet shoe box that resembles a cassette tape. So cute."
"I own Salomon, Merrell, North Face, etc. trail shoes and Saucony is right in with them on quality for a decent price (especially these shoes I got for $34). Plus, they are generally a lot more comfortable. If you haven't bought a pair of Saucony trail shoes, I recommend you try them, you might just become a convert. I rarely give 5 stars on anything because nothing is perfect but if I could, I'd give these a 4.75 star rating. Too bad they are out of production. I personally loved the Raptor TR black and yellow shoe. Although they weren't pretty, they were super rugged shoes with premium comfort. Probably the best trail shoe I've owned. Tread lasted forever and had great grip in varied environments."
"When hubby asked me to find him a pair of size 10 wide tennis shoes and gave me 2 color options, the search was on. If I found one the right size, it was the wrong color, and if it was the right color, it wasn't available in a 10 wide. Then I found this one and the color was acceptable and the size was right. But having never heard of this brand, I was hesitant. After a little more searching to no avail, I bit the bullet. The shoes fit perfectly and hubby is very pleased with the color. So if you are hesitating, don't. I would highly recommend this brand of shoe and this seller."
"Had a pair in a different color, like them so much thought I'd buy the other lighter color.  All is good, great fit, good style too.  I just added a better arch support as my feet need the extra higher arch.  For the money these are great shoes.  I have several pairs of Saucony shoes and they are always comfortable."
Far too narrow for my feet. I usually wear 13 or 12 wide. I've never had to order 13 wide running shoes before. So narrow that my foot was bowed and the upper was straining out over the sole.
This is my third pair of trainers and I do not change the Saucony brand. A little narrow but they work very well. I have used New Balance and Nike but they do not have the same quality and resistance. 100% recommended
"I depend on Saucony products since this brand is one of the few that fit me well. But this particular model is just incredibly painful to walk in - feels as if you're walking barefoot on stones. Saucony is still my go-to brand - but will be very wary of prices that are too cheap. As is said, you get what you pay for."
My second pair of Saucony running shoes. Unfortunately the material ring at the top of the shoe that you stick your foot in is beginning to split. They still work well so I’ll keep them. Just a wee bit disappointed.
"Needed a new pair for every day use and since I already have a pair of running shoes from Saucony, I know exactly what size to order.  The fitting is spot on and the shoes feel nice and light.  Hope they would last much longer than my last pair from New Balance."
The pair I got in my norma size was too small. Recommend going up 1/2 size and may wven want a wide width
Like everything about the shoe except the toe box is slightly narrow. Hoping it'll wear in
"Estos tenis lo necesito para trotar y me quedaron demasiado grandes, cuando troto voy tropezando con la punta del tenis por lo grande que me quedan.Aquí en Mexico siempre compro tenis del 26.5 y siempre me han ajustado bien, pero estos tenis vienen demasiado grandes."
"Tenis súper cómodos y agradables para ejercicio, correr e incluso jornadas largas de trabajo"
Muy bonitos pero sobre todo muy cómodos. Excelentes para caminar.
Llevo un mes con ellas y han cumplido las expectativas. Recomendadas
"This is my third DPR, and at first was not sure, then I got a second pair after I wore out the other ones.  Then I realized these are great.  I used them for weight pack rucking and I have not complains.  The hear support is perfect, as it's more support on the sides, rather then the back (which relieves any achilles irritation).  I wish Adidas would update, but I guess that is not the case."
"My first pair of ""boost"" shoes. I wanted to try the Pure before shelling out for the Ultras. These have been my daily driver shoes for about a month, and they're pretty comfortable right out of the box. Not a ton of support, but very cushiony and pleasant to walk with.My one major complaint was a the shoelaces it comes with are COMICALLY, laughably short. Like. I can barely get these tied, they come undone every few hours. Double knotting is impossible. You will need to buy new shoelaces. I haven't bought new laces yet because I'm lazy, I've just been dealing it. But it's seriously ridiculous. Can barely tie a basic knot, it'll only be down to the plastic tipped ends.I feel like Adidas can invest in more.... universal length laces. If these laces are made for these shoes they should be sufficiently long. Otherwise it seems like they pulled the laces off of a child's shoe and stuck it on these Pureboosts lol."
"Fairly comfortable and light, light mesh good for hot weather. Good looking.Good for walking around, but I wouldn't make them my running shoes.I like low profile, natural running shoes. These are low profile but the sole is strange (to say the least) for running traction.The heel has a finish that needs some walking time to make it comfortable, strange finish fro running shoes which you expect to put on and run. These started to rub my heels just as I was walking around the house trying them.More like walking shoes than running shoes."
"These Adidas Pureboost DPR running shoes are really comfortable, breathable, lightweight and fit true to size. Wouldn't use these for longer runs but works well for walking, gym sessions or casual to moderate running. The tongue could be improved to something thicker/ more substantial. Adidas did include a decent insole which isn't the case with many running shoes. They have the same boost tech in the more expensive Adidas running shoes."
I now own 6 pairs because they are the best running shoe/every day shoe I’ve ever walked/ran in. I asked a really fat guy once how they feel with all his weight. He swore by them. I’m never going back.
"I paid only ~$85 for these shoes, and they're excellent after you break them in. I also love On-Cloud, but they're typically $125, so these are a much better value.I love that they don't use vanity sizing. My size 10 fits well. For On-Cloud and Brooks, you have to order an entire size upwards."
"I have plantar fasciitis and always buy the orthopedic shoes. They are so expensive, so I decided to give these a try because of the good ratings. I’ve been wearing them everyday since they arrived. I am very pleased. They are very comfortable and supportive. I would definitely buy these again."
I have been walking inside and needed more support than the crocs I had been wearing. I liked these so well that I ordered other colors for the coming spring and summer.
"The media could not be loaded.
                




   We are creatures of habit and I got on here to purchase my usual pair of running shoes. Since the pain in my knee was more often that tells me it’s time to replace the running shoes. These were off to the side as a recommendation so I checked them out after reading the reviews and watching the video I thought I would give them a try. I have a torn meniscus and arthritis in my left knee and the support sounded appealing. So glad I did!!!  Everyday midway through my walk I typically experience some knee pain. I have not had any pain since I received these shoes a few days ago!!🙂"
So impressed with this show. I high high arches snd need support. Really comfortable for walking dog. Nice design snd like the hot pink!  Definitely recommend! I have really hard to fit feet as I get older to find something comfortable!
"Purple color is pretty.  The toe area is very narrow.  I ordered size 11  are too short, my toes touching the top and squeezed in so toes overlap.  I have a narrow foot and my American size is 9.5 narrow according to the measuring devices we have in the US. I have to get size 11 for anything made in China, but their patterns are variable and inconsistent. There is a very strong overpowering glue smell, not a  good sign for those who are allergic to the glues and synthetic materials used in manufacture of this product.  The foot bed was not very cushioned, and felt very uncomfortable after a few minutes of trying them on."
"I got these for work. I'm a nurse and work 12.5 hour shifts on the floor. These are super comfortable, with good arch support, and my feet and back feel so much better than in my old shoes. The side of the shoe did start to crease up a bit already, but that's irrelevant to me personally. I would definitely buy these shoes again. I'll probably get another pair or two soon, just in different colors. I did get size 9, which is half size up for me which was perfect. By the end of a shift my regular size shoes get too tight.I also got a pair of Brooks for comparison, and those are good too but of course more expensive at $180+, and these Kubua were easier to break in and more comfortable straight out of the box.Would definitely recommend, especially for anyone needing arch support and on their feet for a long time. A good purchase!"
"I was excited when these came, the arch support was exactly what I needed.  After wearing them, though, the top of my foot hurt so bad, I could barely walk.  I'll try them again for an hour or so in a week."
"At this price point this shoe is amazing. It feels good on your feet and provides good support. I don't recommend running in these shoes but if you need to buy a pair of running shoes for work or to walk around in get these shoes. The shoes I was looking at run from $149 - $199 for 1 pair and you can buy 4 or 5 pair of these. I also should note that I have really flat feet with a bad hip and after 1 day in these arch shoes my hip felt better. And they look awesome. Everyone I meet tells me how good they look.  Another note, they do run big but I wear a 7.5 and generally get an 8 like in Skechers or Adidas but they don't seem to sell half sizes. I got the 8 and it is a bit big after about 2 weeks of everyday walking. It fits like an 8 not a 7.5 if that helps."
"I'd get foot pain standing 8 hrs at work. I was looking to buy a pair of Vionic sneakers but they were out of my size so I decided to give this a try. I'm glad I did! They are cushiony but with a little harder sole that won't give me pain like other Sketcher's cloud shoes do (they don't work well on my feet when I'm standing). I took one star off because they were a bit wide for my narrow feet and my left shoe felt off-balanced. It's been 3 months and still holding up well. I would love it if they come in more modern colors (like Dark Grey, light grey with white/black accent instead of bright yellow or pink accent) and sleek design. I would buy another pair if they do!"
"I suffer from plantar fasciitis terribly and am always looking for comfortable shoes, that won’t  cost a fortune. After reading all the reviews I took a chance on them, because the price was good. The first few times I wore them I wasn’t sure if I liked them. But now after breaking them in a bit, they are my new favorite. They have good arch support and I find them extremely comfortable. They are not the most attractive shoes, but I’ll take comfort over fashion any day. Think I’m going to have to order a second pair. I usually wear a 6 1/2 or 7. I ordered the 7 and they fit perfect."
"Mia figlia è soddisfatta, usate e riusate e ancora in buono stato"
"Es la calidad NB. Pero lo metieron en una bolsa, al venir de tan lejos sufrió maltrato, la caja de cartón delgado de los tenis se rompió y los tenis se aplastaron. Por eso doy dos estrellas, la queja es por la paquetería que finalmente afecta el aspecto del producto, tendré que limpiarlos y ormarlos."
"Me gustaron, llegaron rápido, talla exacta, cómodos, si son originales"
"Son de gamuza, y muy cómodos lucen mucho por sus apliques en color bronce"
Esta muy bonito y super cómodo .
"Viene un poco amplio, mi pie es delgado."
Excelente
Arrived perfect the pic DON'T do these Black n Gold shoes justice. The black is nice n Deep Black an the Y/Gold is more 10-14 kt. Not that extra brassy shiney 18 kt. The laces are nice wide n thick not skinney GARBADGE. The soles are so soft an get oddly Very Supportive I have an high arch an not 1 step have I took an stretched my Arch to pain NOT ONCE. I RECOMMEND YOU BUY YOU & Ur Whole ENTIRE Family a pair or 2. An with so many different colors to choose from that will be very EASY. GOOD LUCK MANY BLESSINGS & ENJOY
I didn't like these because they are knock offs!!!
These were very disappointing.  They must be extremely old or knock offs.
Fits true to size. Super lightweight and really cute
Muy comodos
The sole of the shoe offers the kind of support and comfort you expect from a Skechers shoe. The topline of the shoe on the other hand feels like it has a piece of wire in it with little or no padding or protection to keep it from rubbing your foot. This shoe scrapes the back of my heel when I walk and pinches the bridge of my foot when I go up stairs.  The more I wear the shoes the worse it is getting.
"I like the look of this shoe and I love Skechers products. This shoe is not quite as comfortable and I have to cushion my heel area as it caused blisters. I'm hoping as they ""wear in"" this will get better and softer."
"I ONLY BUY SKETCHERS. I do not buy any other shoe for walking or sport. This is not really a distance walking shoe but is a casual comfortable shoe and I wear them out all the time. If on a trip where I would walk, I go with the Sketchers Go Walk 3. That is a great sole for walking support. This is a comfort daily shoe. Yes, I would certainly buy again!!!"
"Almost like wearing a slipper.  This shoe is surprisingly comfortable.  It fits well and provides some cushion. The holes in the upper material also allow the feet to breathe a little.  It's a little on the loose side, rather than being very snug, but I like that."
"The shoe is basically all plastic, so it isn’t very soft and the back digs into your heel. Had hoped it would soften a bit when worn in, but I can’t wear them unless I want to bleed. The insole is also quite uncomfortable as there is no actual arch support —just the gel foam which flattens under pressure. I have other pairs of Skechers I love, but these ones are awful."
"These seem pretty cheap.  The back cuts right into my heel--which is odd because I usually have problems with the heels being too big.  This has to do with the way the shoes are molded, it actually curves into your heel.  Going to stick with Clarks."
"First clue these were not new.  Shoes came in a box with rubber band around it.  There was no tissue paper noin the box, just 2 shoes.  Shoes had no protective inserts in them.  There were no tags giving information  about the shoes.  There was a plastic ring on one shoe  to hold info but it was empty.  obviously these had been tried on and/or used. Returned."
"El modelo es muy lindo, pero no me quedó nada bien, cuando apoyaba el pie se abria de modo muy feo para mi. Lamentablemente no lo pude usar y lo regalé. A lo mejor a personas con pies mas delgados le quedarian mejor."
"I liked the shoes but after wearing them a short amount of time, the back of the shoes rubbed my heels uncomfortably.  I have many pairs Sketcher shoes and this is the first style that I've had this problem with."
"I really love the style and color of this shoe!  The heathered black is a nice change over an all black or solid dark grey shoe.  They are okay comfort wise.  I stand and walk for most of the day and these shoes aren't the most comfortable, but they aren't horrible either. There's plenty of room in the toe box.  I'll keep wearing them, but may try adding some insoles.  I stayed with my regular size 9.5 and they fit great.5 stars for style, 3.5 stars for comfort."
"I never owned a pair of Reef sneakers before (only sandals) and was hesitant about purchasing, but really liked the design/colors. I'm so glad I bought these...the quality is excellent, great price and they're really comfortable. What more could you ask for! Will definitely order more colors."
"I only paid $15 for these shoes, so I wasn't expecting much. They are really awesome! I can wear them to work, and they are super comfy!  Get them!! You won't be disappointed."
Great shoe but I ordered a 9.5 because of the need to possibly size up because of another reef purchase but I would have been fine with just a 9. I wear them everyday
Runs small and narrow. Quality is below what I expected
I love it
"I read the reviews, normally wear a size 8 but I ordered a 9 and they fit good."
Reef rovers are my absolute favorite shoes! I have 5 different pairs now! :) Ordered half size up. PERFECT
"Great shoe, size up!"
Nice
Purchased for water sports but like fit so much I am wearing outside of water.
Great shoe
"Got perfect , and comfortable to run in"
"Been wearing this pair for a few months and it’s one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I’ve ever worn. I run weekly, and in addition, I walk a ton at my current job, and this pair fits all my needs.It fits exactly to my foot size. I probably should’ve bought a size bigger if I wanted to wear thicker socks, but it’s not a big deal. Still a good pair."
Nice looking runner.. but not the most comfortable... not much support in arch
Super comfy... improved in comfort since the last pair of Boston shoes I purchased 7 years ago!They last forever!!!
"These are amazing. Stylish, comfortable, perfect!"
"I love then, very happy i purchase then.."
Todo bien ! Un excelente servicio
its the best shoes
Super lightweight and comfortable. Just what I was looking for.
Bueno el producto
"I ordered these shoes and paid for expedited shipping. When I received them I noticed the box was pretty banged up. No big deal. Opened the box and when I looked at the shoes they had clearly been tried on and returned. How do I know? Because there was Loads of animal hair on the inside. Someone with pets had been walking around their house with socks on before trying on the shoes. Lots of black cat/dog hair. I needed the shoes the day they were delivered so I called Amazon and they gave me a small discount so I kept them. Still grossed me out having to clean them out though! Besides that, I love the shoes. Super cute, comfy and fit as expected."
Molto comodi e ad un prezzo modesto
開放感、通気性が最高です。（他のアウトドアブランドのトゥキャップ付きは、蒸れるし、開放感が無いので）シルバークラウドのカラーもNEW BALANCE M990好きの自分にとっては、最高です。昨年購入した、HURRICANE  XLT は、ストラップが、パイル&フック式で、フィット感ももう少しでした。そして、脱ぎ履きが、とても面倒でした。今年のHURRICANE VERGEは、フィット感も向上し、ストラップが、バックル式になったので、脱ぎ履きが、楽になりました。そして、クッション性も向上しています。これからの季節、最高のサンダルだと思います。
ずーーーーっと気になってました。でも天邪鬼な僕は「別に興味ねーし。」みたいな感じで見て見ぬふりをしてました。妻もハリケーンを欲しがったのでお店で試し履き。。。履き心地というかクッションが半端なくいい。下手な運動靴より気持ちいい。ハリケーンはベルトの脱着がめんどくさそうだったのでコチラを購入。ただ、カチャカチャのところのベルトが緩む。とコメントしている方がいますが僕のも緩みます。が、爪先も踵もソコソコ締め付けてるので緩んだままでも問題ない感じです。なんだかんだでハリケーンも欲しくなっちゃってます。
見た目はtevaのサンダルの中でも重厚でインパクトはあります。履き心地も、厚いソールの為、どこまでも歩けそうです。しかし、いざ歩き始めると足の甲にあるストラップ横のファスナーがすぐ緩みます。気になる人にはかなり気になってしまいそうです。歩いてはファスナーを引っ張り、また歩いて緩む、の繰り返しが面倒くさいです。ここは改善が望まれます。
"デザインが気に入りました。心配だったのは、クッションと靴ズレでした。皮膚が弱く新しい靴を履いた当日は踵や当たる部分で靴ズレを起こします。サンダルも例外ではなく、ビルケンやクロックでも、慣れるまでは痛い思いをします。結論から言えば素晴らしいサンダルです！初日、10,000歩以上歩くハメになったのですが、まったく靴ズレしませんでした。機能、快適性を考えた素材選びやパッドの配置をしているのでしょう。それでいて個性的なデザインを維持出来ているのが魅力です。クッション性能も申し分なく。寒くて履けなくなるまでは定番にします。"
甲、かかと、足首と３点で支えているためフィット感があり、一方で開放感保たれていて快適です。ベルトが緩むというレビューがあり不安でしたが、いまのところそのようなトラブルはありません。1点、横着してそのまま履くと、しばしばベルト部が折れ曲がったまま体に密着して、痛いです。
ちょい大きいかなと思いましたが、ベルトの調整でなんとかなったかなという感じ。使っていくと足になじんでいく感じです。今年は出かけられなかったので、来年は河原とか海辺で使用してみたいです。いいタイミングで買えたので価格も抑えられて満足。
"Comfortable, light, nice dark forest green,"
色は正にフカミドリ。あんまり見かけない色だと思う。キャンプなどアウトドア好きな私としてはもう少しそっちよりの色合いだと嬉しかったが充分満足です。履き心地も固くなく柔らか過ぎでも無い絶妙な感覚。ソールのヘタリも今の所大丈夫そう。何年も履きたい、そんなサンダルに出会えた。
かかとのバンドのグリップ位置が少し低めでした。簡単に脱げちゃいそうで、私には、いまいち会いませんでした。やはり、身につけるものは、自分で現物を履いてみないとわかりません。
"Todo lo de palladium me encanta, son lindos, súper cómodos, en general siempre he estado muy satisfecha con cada par que he comprado, la valoración no tiene que ver con el producto sino con la talla y que aunque dice que es de mujer, mandan talla de hombre así que siempre va a quedar grande"
"La talla americana es para calzado de hombres, me quedó muy grande pero de calidad"
"I am putting 5 starts to this shoes because I have another palladium shoes. Which I love, is very hard to find shoes that are comfortable for my feet and palladium are the best.But, I ordered this shoes and they came in the wrong size. So I am returning them and buying them smaller, I loved the quality and style of this shoe, too bad are big and now I have to wait even longer for my new pair."
"This sneakers looks good, good quality. The size is not as described on this item. I chose 7 for women but it is 7 for men."
"Cute shoes, nicely made, but size was at least a full size too large.  Sadly had to return them."
"Desafortunadamente no son los mismos de la publicación, lo que si es que son súper cómodos"
It’s so perfect while working so light and soft so good
Perfect work shoes for me...i went 1/2 size higher..(From 9.5 Wide to 10 Wide)wide toe area...i can walk mile and mile a day with this shoes...it actually eliminates my knee pain ...highly recommended...i will buy this again..
"I stand in these over 8 hrs per day in a data center.. They're comfy, good looking and light in weight. Better than any composite toe footwear I've ever used hands down."
Its comfortable and definitely suggest ordering at least .5 size smaller . Im a 9.5 and I ordered a 9 and there is still some wiggle room. Brand new out the box letters were coming off so i don't trust this quality much.UPDATE: see last picture . 1 month in and bottom part is peeling out
Bad
They are my favorites shoes to work
"I usually wear 10.5 for Nike. I ordered a size 10 on these Reebok work shoes and they fit perfectly. I love how they look and feel, but durability remains to be seen."
"best safety toe shoe I have found yet.they fit a little bigger than expected, but that's ok by me.also love the wide toe cap, not jamming my toes on safety cap!gave them a four cause they could use better arch support."

I love the look of this shoes and wanted them to fit so much.There is no room for the toes… I ordered a size bigger and my toes were still showing lol! I don’t have fat toes
"Sind sehr zufrieden, haben diese Stiefel schon zum dritten Mal gekauft. 2 Kinder die einfach zu schnell wachsen."
Tolle Qualität und super Komfort👌
"Preis Leistung Verhältnis ist gut ich finde zwar das es für einen Kinderschuh sehr überteuert ist ,aber  das Qualitätsversprechen ist voll erfüllt"
Halt warn und trocken.
We like Superfit
"Las sandalias son bonitas y cómodas, lo esperado de Teva (además utilizan plástico reciclado en su fabricación). Quedan como se esperaba y son muy duraderas (siempre compro esta marca por el buen resultado, calidad y comodidad)"
Teva toooop!Colori brillanti e ottima resistenza. Sono molto belli e calzano perfettamente la propria misura!Consigliatissimi.
"Typisch Teva- zuverlässige Passform, tolle Qualität. Sehr zu empfehlen."
"Perfectas, la misma calidad que las de adulto para niños"
"Son geniales, a mi hija le encantan y va súper cómoda. Se nota q es teva"
Comodisimas y la talla tal cual esperaba.
"Schnelle Lieferung, Ware passt und in Ordnung. - Vielen Dank, gerne wieder!"
"Producto incometo, solo llegó la pieza izquierda"
In general all Teva sandals are awesome and these are no exception. The fit is right on. I wouldn't size up or down. My daughter loves them and wants to wear them every day. We accidentally ordered 2 pairs in the same size but are seriously thinking of keeping the extra pair!
"Perfect summer sandal. We bought ours a little big since we live in San Diego, we are almost always at the beach or in the water. Our son loved these, very well made and the blue matched his glasses. Will be ordering more from this seller"
"Guten Tag, die gekauften Schuhe entsprachen meinen Vorstellungen, sie sind bequem, ich trage sie sehr gerne.Die Verarbeitung ist nicht so gut, es müssen andere Kleber verwendet werden..Da ich im Sommer Sandaletten getragen habe, nutze ich sie nun öfter.Leider löste sich an beiden Schuhen seitlich die Sohle. Ich habe vergessen zu fotografieren und habe sie desshalb sofort von einem Orthopädieschuhmachermeister reparieren lassen.Der Grund dafür ist, daß ich in diesem Jahr 5 HüftOP hinter mir. Damit ist eine Beinverkürzung rechts um 3 cm eingetreten. Deßhalb mußte ich rechts die Sohle erhöhen lassen. Da ich auch nur ein paar Schuhe, abgesehen von Sandaletten und Hausschuhen für dieses Makel anfertigen lassen konnte. war eine sofortige Reparatur notwendig. Sonst hätte ich dies Schuhe zurückgeschickt. Ich bitte den Anbieter mit mir Kontakt aufzunehmen."
Gute trage Eigenschaften kann ich weiter empfehlen
"Ein schöner Schuh. Wenn man aber größere 39 bestellt und größere 40 geliefert bekommt,ist das nicht gut.Ganz schwach ,wenn man die Größe mit Klebeband überklebt und 39 draufschreibt. Schade,keine Entschuldigung."
"Diesen Schuh kann ich nur empfehlen, Sitz gut ,super bequem und Preis Leistungsverhältnis stimmt . Absolut Super.Habe Gr 44 und die Gr stimmt auch .👍👍"
"Vor genau 8 Wochen hier gekauft . Jetzt löste sich bei einem Schuh die Sohle auf ca. 12 cm Länge an der Innenseite .Habe noch ein Paar in anderer Farbe nachgekauft ,mal sehen wie langedie halten ."
Miese Quali - nach vier Wochen fallen die Sohlen ab. Besser richtige Schuhe kaufen!
Sehr schnelle Lieferung.Schuhe entsprechen meinem Erwartungen
Super bequem weiche innensohle .
"Parecen muy cómodas y son bastante flexibles. A mi hija pequeña le encantan, y ya hemos pedido otras para la mayor."
"Der Schuh ist angenehm im Tragen, sehr leicht. Sieht gut aus- nun warte ich wie lang hält."
"Meine Tochter ist 4 Jahre alt und hat schmale Füße. Wir haben diesen Schuh bereits in der fünften Größe und auch in mehreren Farben.Wird täglich im Kindergarten, auf dem Spielplatz und auch zum Ausgehen getragen da er nach der Waschmaschine aussieht wie neu 😊"
Sehr bequemer Schuh gutes Preis Leistung Verhältnis
"Gute Schuhe, gute Qualität! Halten einiges aus!"
These are nice looking and super soft on the feet. They feel like you are wearing slippers and they fit as expected.Good buy! I highly recommend them. Propet is a very good brand name to start and they make quality shoes for hard to fit sizes.
"It isn't easy finding a good fit when you wear wide sizes, but these are great!"
"I have looked for a pair of nice black walking shoes to replace my current pair and they all looked too bulky...aka ""old lady"". When I found these, I decided to give them a shot. These shoes fit perfectly (10 M) right out of the box. In addition, they are very light weight, very attractive and very well made. I wore them and walked back and forth to check for rubbing, pinching etc....totally comfortable with a wide enough toe box and this is with medium thickness socks. These shoes are pre-treated to discourage stains since they are suede and the tag says that they are washable...we will see. I have never cared for the heavy white athletic shoe look, so this shoe goes with clothing much better.I like these shoes so much that my husband suggested that I go ahead and purchase a second pair since so frequently companies will either stop selling something or they will change something."
"Ah! I am sooo glad I discovered these shoes. I have very wide feet due to bunionettes on both feet, and most shoes, even ""wide"" width, are not wide enough to be as comfortable as I'd like. The first time I ordered a pair of these shoes, about a couple of years ago, I got the C/D width, never dreaming that I could possibly need anything wider. They were very comfortable, but I still saw the outside edge of my foot pushing out beyond the shoe. I figured I'd have to live with my ""problem"", because I was sure that anything wider would be TOO wide for the rest of my foot. I took a chance and ordered this pair in a 2E, and I've come to realize that I actually DO need a 2E! It pays to measure your feet, or have them measured for you. I think many folks are wearing the wrong size shoe! These are perfect.... I no longer see the outside of my foot trying to push over the side of the shoe, and they're not too big elsewhere. The Propet Washable Walkers fit so perfectly, it's like they were made for me! I've since ordered 2 more pairs in different colors, as these are now about the only shoe I wear. They are great-looking, well-made, comfy, supportive, not ""heavy"", and they are washable! What's not to love?"
"My wife loved the design/color of the Propet Women's W3841 Sneaker, Classic Taupe; however, she had to return them because they were too small. All of her shoes are 10 M, and she received a 10 M size this time also; however, the cut/style of this shoe must be different, because for some reason they were too tight on her feet. She was disappointed because apparently they do not make a size 10.5 M and she was doubly disappointed that she had to pay the return shipping of $16 (over 20% of the cost of the shoe). Buyers beware."
"Loved these so much, I stocked up. Comfy and warm to toes on chilly days without bulk. Wore them after broken foot bone healed. Have had no pain or arthritis in foot from injury since. I have actually fallen asleep in these. Look like suede but go in the wash. Sole is flexible so feet and ankles don't get stiff from an overly rigid shoe. Designed to gently make your foot do the work. Good for your tired dogs. Soothing to your feet.  Propet tends to run narrow-you may want to size up, though my first pair were a B width, have had some foot swelling since first pair, so I got the  E or W ( either designation is for wide)."
"Wish I had known they run large. I don’t require wide size, however my feet tend to be more wide than narrow.  Did not realize until I had worn these for a while that they rub my toe because they are just a tad too wide.I’ve solved the problem with thick soxs  & a wrap on toe, but if ordering again would order half a size smaller.Actually, I may order another pair in a different color because they are very comfortable."
This is a nice looking shoe and looks like it would be very comfortable IF you don’t need a wide toe box.  Sneakers with narrow toes don’t make sense to me.  Tried an extra wide width to see if that would make it work but still too narrow in toes and too wide in heel.
"The shoe arrived quickly and in good condition.  We ordered a ""9 Narrow"" and noticed that the shipping email indicated that a ""9.5 Narrow"" was to be shipped.  Contacted Matt @ Orthotic Shop by email and he responded immediately, indicating that he would attempt to change the size prior to shipping.  He wrote back later that same day and told me that he was unable to intercept the order.When the shoes arrived, my wife loved the look and the feel.  The fit was just a bit roomy for her narrow foot but the shoes were very comfortable to wear.  She is keeping them.  Maybe the Propet denim sneakers run a half-size small.  The workmanship appears to be quality work.  My wife will use them as walking shoes and as a fashion accessory -- they are dressy enough to wear with both jeans and good slacks."
"I've only worn these shoes once because I bought them to wear in colder weather.  We've just entered Fall and the temps are dropping so I'll soon be wearing them more often.  I bought this shoe in a ""double wide'.  I've never bought or owned a pair of shoes in that width so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I like the extra room in the toe box and I'll be able to wear thicker socks once it gets cooler outside.  I treated the shoes with a protectant so they should be good for the entire season.  I like the neutral color and I'll be able to ""pair"" them with many different outfits.  So far, they're very comfortable and I'm looking forward to getting years of use out of them."
"Ended up returning. The style wasn't what I was expecting. This is why I don't like ordering shoes online, or clothes for that matter, it's always going to be a hit or miss if it fits and mostly, at least for me, it's typically a miss. I just expect better from a name brand like Skechers."
"I have owned many Skechers boots, and all have fit me well in my size. I would have liked these, and after a few reviews that said they ran a little wide, I was expecting a better fit. Dont know if the pair sent to me was mis-labeled, but I normally wear a 10 and these were at least 2 full sizes too small. Good quality however."
"I like these. They look good, fit well. Only issue is the sole isn't the best and it wears on the feet quickly. Since I really only wear these out on social occasions, it doesn't bother me too much."
My husband only wears this brand of shoes to work in. He’s on his feet a lot and really likes these shoes. He use to buy  them at shoe dept but haven’t found them in a while. Last few times had to buy them online.
"These are wonderful. Extremely slip resistant, which is a major plus for me as a double below knee amputee. I walk all over and have to find shoes that are slip resistant and these fit the bill nicely. They walk comfortably, but I can not say if they feel good on my feet. But my wife says they look good and well slip resistance and looking good is all I need."
"If you have a wide foot...this one is for you.  I added a custom insert for my feet, but that was it."
"I originally ordered a 10 1/2 which is my normal size for Sketchers . But they were way too big. I re-ordered a 10 and they fit better but are still a little big in the width. They fit almost like a ""wide"" versus a normal width. They are very comfortable but there is just a little too much room in the width. I will be keeping them and just use them for a winter boot with thicker socks."
I them because they are light
My husband loves these shoes. It was worrisome to habe to order online but we had zero issues. They fit wonderfully and work great.
Great shoes! Fit true to size and my fiancé says they are comfortable
"Muy bonitos y cómodos, vienen un número más chico, yo soy 5mx y pedí 4mx, me quedaron perfectos"
So cute lots of Complements fit true to size the colors are amazing in the spring and summer
"Gorgeous, great for running and comfortable. Love the colors!"
Had to return fit to big
So comfortable amazing colors very trendy I love them a must have😍👟
El tenis está hermoso me quedaron un poco ajustados pero están hermosos
Not for walking. Found these uncormfortable as they rub my toes and are tough
very good
See prev. post...
"De los mejores diseños, súper cómodos y de buen material!"
"The shoes look and feel great! My husband has been looking for a good sturdy pair of shoes without getting ""dad shoes"" 😊 very comfortable, our sons 15 and 12 now was some too.UPDATE: THE SIDE OF THE SHOE CAME APART AFTER MINIMAL WEAR. VERY DISAPPOINTED, THOUGHT WE HAD FINNALY FOUND A WINNER."
"honestly my favorite shoe EVER but the first time i put them on the little thing that helps you pull the shoe on on the back ripped off so easily :(( but i was too excited abt them at the time to switch them out so i just stuck tape on it. frustrating & super disappointing, but i love the shoes so much. (ps they are dirty in the pic bc i’ve been wearing them so much but they are also really easy to clean)"
my grandson loves this shoes will be ordering more
"My son wanted a pair like mine, so I ordered him this pair, and he loved them!"
I love its first on my foots.
My son is very happy with his new pair of champion tennis shoes.
Very good
Shoes as fit well
"We were moving and I must have missed this. Just now opened the box. Wrong size. Box says 9.5W, shoes say 8.5. Would love to return these, but it's been too long to do so. Be sure to check inside your box for the right size before it's too late. Wish I had. Darn."
"The fit is ok as the insole seems to be slightly off in one shoe but other than that, for the price, they’re good."
"Le scarpe sono molto belle e secondo me stanno anche molto bene una volta calzate. L'unica ""pecca"" che poi pecca non è, è il fatto che sono un po' troppo chiare ma a questo si può porre rimedio lucidandole con un marrone di una tonalità appena appena più scura. La pelle sicuramente non è pregiatissima, ma per quanto le ho pagate direi che il rapporto qualità/prezzo è più che vantaggioso."
"First, I am a HUGE Adidas fan, it and 1 other are the only brands I wear, but... these are a no. They look normal, but when they showed up they are stiff and feel very cheap. Sorry. I haven’t returned them so they are just hanging out in my closet. Also, they run big so if you make the mistake of buying these order them one and a half sizes smaller."
"Sehr bequemer Schuh, habe ihn noch in schwarz und braun, leider sind sie nicht wie auf dem Bild weinrot, sondern eher lila Aubergine. Da ich sie zu einem sehr günstigen Preis erstanden habe, behalte ich sie."
"Cheap and probably not actually Adidas....they looked like crap after wearing them for one day. I followed the advice of other reviews and bought a size down so they fit correctly but the are just a very ugly poorly made shoe. Hard, uncomfortable, flimsy etc. etc. etc."
Mycket bra skinn kvalitet! Gått om plats för tårna även med tjocka strumpor! Rekommenderar till alla som har bredare fötter!
"These are the biggest shoes in the world. I wear an 8, the 8 was enormous. I ordered a 7, I have two inches of room.  I’m giving up."
"Die Schuhe sind super! Sie sind aus weichem Leder, haben eine ausreichende Breite (wie in der Beschreibung), sind sehr bequem. Die Farbe ist eher lila als rot, aber schön. Ich habe noch andere Caprice Schuhe und bin mit allen zufrieden. Ich empfehle sie!"
Order a size down. The shoes are perfect and very comfortable
Warto kupić.Buty wygodne- skorzane- lekkie
Shoes are comfortable and cute
"Sehr bequeme Freizeitschuhe. Erfüllt voll und ganz, was ich erwartet hatte!"
These run large so order down in size. Great shoes. Cute but I wear 8.5 in every brand of shoe including adidas and these particular ones run big.
"Bon produit, cuir très souple élastique sur le côté de la chaussures qui permet de les mettre très facilement."
"True to size, perfect addition to my shoe collection. Very comfortable."
Much to large. Maybe miss labeled.
Kinda comfortable but order a size smaller because too big.
Le scarpe sono comode e bellissime a mia figlia sono piaciute molto. La misura è giusta e sono arrivate nei termini giusti. Le consiglio
Scarpa perfetta numero giusto
I am a huge rocket dog brand fan and these was on sale so I took a chance. I wear a size 9 and they fit true to size. I already received a compliment from a dr on how cute and comfy they look! She was gonna order a pair. They are stylish and fit very firm. A tighter slip on since they have the extra cushion part around the ankle. I like them and they look very nice!
As expected. Good looking.
This is my first time wearing this brand I am impressed
These are rather comfortable and a beachy vibe
"Cute, very comfortable and well priced"
Instant
Definitely comfy AF and perfect if your looking for something practical n convenient to slip on and go.
"Yes, good quality shoes"
Great and easy refund policy and support
These are the most comfortable shoes. I love wearing them
Seller communication was good. Didn't like shoes.
Great Qulaity Reebok Nylon Classic... Fast Ship & 10/10 for Seller.... :)
I love these sneakers! I had a pair back in 1987 and they were super cute snd comfortable. Very happy with my purchase.
"Not bad, like the classic look."
Love and great price
I love these for my daughter. Fits true to size and great price.
"Perfect Fit, great style. My son loves them"
Great shoe
Ordered the wrong size
Très bon produit et souple dans les pieds
"Wow! These are amazing!!!! Perfect for HIIT workouts and strength training!  The only thing is getting use to slipping them on given they don’t open in the laces area and have a higher ankle, bur that’s a matter of getting use to it.  The feel and ability to workout out in them is amazing!  They fit true to size."
"The color is more pale pink than I expected.  The sizing is true to size. My only concern is the sole isn’t very shock absorbent. Not sure I’ll keep, they feel a bit hard sole’d for how thick the sole is. Not very cushiony."
Very comfy shoes! Make sure to clean regularly to maintain color.
perfecto
Los zapatos son muy lindos pero aprietan esas tiras negras
Love this brand
Great for bmx.  Great price and fits right.
Ordered size 3.5 fits my 9 year old perfect.
Great colour to wear with lots of casual clothes.Some arch support so nice for walking. Lots of compliments on them.
"This is my 2nd pair. I love these shoes. Super comfortable and fashionable too. The only complaint I have is that they don't wash well. If you buy a pair, scotchguard them so they will last longer."
"Love my Sperrys!!  True to size! Only gripe, I did not like the leather shoe laces. So I replaced them with no tie laces and the hold them securely to you foot. Easy on and off. And now the shoe doesn't bulge out making your foot look fat"
I love these shoes. The fit and appearance are great! They are a lot like the feel of the body of a cleat. It's a nice snug/wrap of the foot. I have narrow feet so I like a snug feel. Even if I had wider feet I wouldn't shy away from them. They are great quality and comfy.
"I bought these shoes for my trip to Washington D.C. I was able to walk around all day and sightsee with no problems. These shoes are definitely a win/win, cute and comfortable."
Comfortable. Good arch support. Attractive.  True to size.  I have narrowish feet so I went down a half size (9.5 to 9) and I'm good.
Larger than expected with the width which cause a lot of heel sliding and toe jamming. If worn with two pairs of socks it is ok
"These shoes are very comfortable,  but a tad large. Since I wear arch supports in my shoes it works well. One shoe came without the ""lace barrel"" so I watched a Sperry YouTube video and did it myself.  This color goes with everything!"
"Very comfortable,even though they fit a bit larger than my other pair of Sperry boat shoes."
LOVE THEM!!  Exactly what I wanted!
"I've been wearing Merrell Slip-on hikers for years.  Every year I buy a size 9.5M.  Fits perfectly...NOT this time.  Shoe won't even go on my foot, feels more like a size 8, or 8.5, despite being labelled a 9.5.Maybe I will brave an actual shoe store, try some Merrell's on again, see what size now is the new 9.5M"
Trop petit impossible de mettre un pied
These are great eveyday shoes I went with the black ..lil stiff on the front of the foot at first after after a couple days the leathers loosens feel moved to the foot...id love to see merrell make this havoc wells slip on in gtx ...i don't wear a wide but i imaging it you have a wide foot they might be on the narrow side ..they have great grip with and ive not experienced any heel slip ...they are more breathable than I expected....i really like them I typically wear a 14 but I went with a 15 and it worked out great ...hopes this helps other buyers
I wear Men's 8.5 regular width shoes - my feet have been this same size for the past 52 years and I have been wearing Merrells pretty much exclusively for the  past 2 decades.  Why?  Consistency. Because they have always fit and they have always fit  as if bespoke.This pair was so narrow I couldn't get my foot into the shoe and were a good one inch longer heel-to-toe when compared with the 8.5 Jungle Moc I was wearing.Weird.  Small.
These shoes look well made but they are incredibly narrow all my life I have worn size 9 to 9.5. I ordered this is 9.5 to be safe. I couldn't even get my forefoot into them. They were insanely narrow. Merrell makes a quality product but they seriously need to fix their sizing.
"Despite having had several pairs of Merrell Mocs, these could not even be put on without fear of breaking a shoe horn.  Understanding that they ran smaller than typical I ordered one size larger than my others, but could only barely try them on, so sent them back.  I wish they fit as well as others like the Desert Moc as they are good looking."
"Very sharp looking, typical Merrill quality. Too bad these were too narrow, slip on opening too small, could get into them with difficulty, but too tight. Need a wide in these, which is not normal for me. Sent back."
A little tight. But hopefully they will loosen up with some wear time.
They run way small or are mislabled
Fit is small and more narrow for wearing with anything but thin socks
Awesome shoes...Great Quality
"La calidad de el zapato es buena, no hay queja en ese aspecto, pero hay dos detalles, el primero que no es un tenis de piel, es piel sintética, en poco palabras hule bonito, y suda el pie, aunque tenga perforado es algo caluroso, y el segundo y el más importante quedan bastante reducidos, si tienes el pie normal, ni delgado ni ancho, pide un número más grande y si tienes el pie ancho pídelo número y medio más grande, esto es importante si quieres que te quede más aceptable, y la parte de los dedos tiende a quedar justos. Son muy bonitos y lo del calor si hace frío no hay problema y son tolerables, pero el tamaño si tómenlo en cuenta."
"Very nice Quality product, good looking too.. with BMW logo"
"Lo regalati a mio marito, li sono piaciuti veramente tanto, poi si è stupito che suoi amici gli hanno chiesto dove lo aveva presi, che erano belli e particolari.No do 5 stelle perche mio marito si lamenta ancora che tenendolo per molto tempo risultano un po' scomodi, stretti e un po' duri, e passato del tempo è ancora uguale, ma comunque piace lo stesso.Consiglio l'acquisto poi che gli ho presi in offerta."
"Für eine Premium Marke eine Enttäuschung.Diese Schuhe sehen schön aus, wenn man die nicht trägt. Leider ist die Qualität so miserable, dass ich die Schuhe nach ca 5 Monaten entsorgen muss. Das BMW Logo löst sich nach kürzester Zeit. Die Schuhe sind sehr eng geschnitten, quasi sehr ungequem. Der Stoff an den Fersenbereich stark abgenutzt obwohl ich die Schuhe nicht so oft trage sehen die aus wie 10 Jahre benutzt. Als deko könnte man die Schuhe nehmen, mehr auch nicht."
"Son muy bonitas y cómodas, lo que siempre pasa con estos modelos de Puma que son angostas en la parte delantera, para mi va bien, pero para un pie más ancho quizás al menos media talla más, tengo ya algunas zapatillas Puma y gasto una 38,y en este modelo también, aunque quizás un pelin más justas, aunque igualmente cómodas. Muy satisfecha con la compra y con el envío como siempre."
"Me encantaron, la verdad tenía duda con respecto a que numero pedir, ya que decían que venía muy reducido. En lo personal solo pedí medio numero mas grande y me quedaron perfecto. Lo que si es que, de lo ancho quedan algo justos, pero para mi, nada incomodo y de lo largo estan bien. Como dije solo medio numero para sentir mayor comodidad."
Not suitable for road running. Very thin sole. Price very high and product is not useful for long distance running on hard roads. I developed pain in my knees and toes after using these shoes for running in military training academy. Due to severe pain in knees I purchased another regular running shoes which went quite easy for me to run  then after.  I urge don't buy this product as it is too expensive and useless.
"Scarpe di ottima fattura, come ci ha abituati Puma, molto belle ed adatte anche sonno un vestito elegante, ovviamente davvero ottime per la guida su auto e su simulatore, io generalmente porto una 47, le ho dovute acquistare 48,5, essendo che 48 non c'era, è stato meglio così.Taglia più grande giustificata dal fatto che sono molto contenitive dato il fatto che devono impedire al piede di incastrarsi vicino ai pedali.Stra consigliate"
"Ich habe für einen Mann einen recht schmalen Fuss und normalerweise eine Schuhgröße von 43.Aufgrund der vielen Bewertungen und Hinweisen zu den Größen bei Puma habe ich Größe 44,5 gekauft. Und, der Schuh ist immer noch eindeutig zu klein! Und vorne vor allem auch zu schmal. Was soll das?"
"Ein fantastischer Schuh, optisch wie auf den Fotos, wirkt sehr hochwertig und am Fuß so ziemlich das Beste, was ich je getragen habe. Da ich die Schuhe täglich von morgens bis abends trage, drinnen wie draußen, kann ich nur sagen: man spürt ihn kaum. Ich habe mir tatsächlich 3 Paar nachbestellt, habe jetzt also insgesamt 4 Paar bestellt, 2 x Cognac,  2 x Dunkelbraun. Den Preis von 67 € konnte ich mir nicht entgehen lassen, und den Schuh werde ich noch lange lieben."
"Dachte, erst mal bestellen und dann schauen wir mal.. Aber ich war beeindruckt; sehr bequem, super Qualität, tolle Passform, ideal mit Jeans.. Die behalte ich auf jeden Fall."
Botas de piel de mucha calidad y muy cómodas de llevar la talla corresponde a la que uno usa
"Gefällt mir sehr, sieht sehr schön aus und sind wirklich bequem ☺️"
Ein absolut schöner und bequemer Schuh!!!
Passt wie gewohnt
Prodotto ottimo!Scarpe da calcio da pro ad un prezzo incredibile!
"Shoes were good, but the insoles fell apart real fast after first couple of uses."
"Super hard to put my foot in. It’s been about 1 month and I’ve worn them about 10 times and it’s still hard to get my foot in. Once my foot is actually in, then they are good cleats. It just takes a long time to break in."
Bought these twice about to get another pair. Takes a little bit to break in.
I'm a player and a referee and I use them for both.  I can run for 6-8 hours in them and they don't hurt my feet.
The shoe is not made for a wide foot. If there's a wide model it's not clear from the site.
Too small
"molto più di una banale ""ciabatta"": oltre ad essere molto calde, la suola è adatta per camminare anche in giardino. Molto confortevole, ottimi i materiali."
Fonctionne comme annoncé et reçu dans le temps prescrit. Fantastique !
thanks!
Perfette e bellissime !!
Bought for my grandsons who love them. They call them their cozy shoes and wear them all day long. They are a attractive well made shoe. I’ve been a satisfied Sorel customer for many years.
These slippers are awesome. Really. Comfortable. Warm. Great non-slip soles. A must buy.
"They are so comfortable (according to my 12 year old), that he forgot to take them off when we headed out the door to school!  They fit as expected, and he loves the grey Sorel slipper.  Great product.  I will definitely purchase again."
"Fits perfectly to size. Comfortable, warm, durable."
"Unser Sohn brauchte neue Sportschuhe für den Sportunterrricht, es mussten Hallen-Fußballschuhe sein. Die meisten Hallensportschuhe sind heutzutage warum auch für schmale Füße gemacht, selbst in der Grüße 45 und 46 ist das so. Nun ja, unser Sohn hat eher maskuline Füße. Letztlich waren diese Schuhe hier der dritte Versuch, die anderen beiden mussten wir zurückgeben. Mit diesen hier sind wir voll und ganz zufrieden. Sie sind gut verarbeitet, sitzen gut, sind rutschfest und man kann damit gut schießen. Daher gerne 5 Sterne."
"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Están muy bien y son muy chulas a mi hijo le an encantado."
Best :)
Scarpe arrivate in 1 giorno sono perfette
size indicators very misleading this shoe approximately two (2) sizes smaller than average
Super
Love it!
"El producto no es como esperaba, encima de mala calidad."
These shoes run very narrow. I have ordered one size up after reading reviews. But it didn't work for me. The shoes squeezed my feet.
Passt gut form
Just got my PUMA sneakers today. Fits good and looks great. I love them 😀👍
Sport
"Bought these for my 12 yr old daughter, she loves them!"
very narrow.....does not stretch
"Item was delivered last night, many thanks"
Beautiful and comfortable.
Second pair of Sanuk yoga slings for kiddo.  She loves the ease and cute style.
"My daughters love these sandals! They're comfortable, hold up well, have great traction, and flexible."
Good sneakers
"Pedido devuelto, no es el producto descrito. No son Brooks Reve 3, envían unas Reebok."
Zapatillas tipo retro de Reebok muy bonitas y muy buen precio. Son cómodas y tallan bien
These boots have a nice design and are sitting well . You get a reebok quality with nice price ... nice buy .. I recommend.
Yo no sé qué pasa pero las he recibido hoy y al ponérmela me di cuenta de que una es blanca y la otra como beis
"Mein Lieblingsschuh,super bequem passt in Gr 41optimal habe ihn in verschiedenen Farben würde ihn wieder kaufen"
Increibles
Perfecto
schöner Retrosneaker. Material und Verarbeitung überzeugen.
満足しています
Finally a Reebok that is very similar to the Reebok Satilite's from the 1990's - the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned !
Muy bonitos y suaves
My daughter loves her new crocs! The fit was perfect and they’re great quality. I will definitely buy again when she needs to go up a size.
"Ich fand den Schuh sehr schön, genauso wie ich es mir erhofft hatte, auch am Fuß war er wirklich super bequem, jedoch quietschte er auf meinen häuslichen Fliesen, ....da ich vorhatte den Schuh auch im Office zu tragen, war das wirklich keine Option mehr für mich. Das hätte mich ja überall zur Lachnummer gemacht, sehr schade um den schönen Schuh."
"This shoes are really comfortable and seem protective for high impact training. Initially they seemed too snug for my feet, I had to loosen up the strings, after that , and after my first aerobics session, I would say they are perfect!"
Merecen la pena especialmente para corredores principiantes y pesados
Der Schuh passt sehr gut. Farbe wie abgebildet. Zügige Lieferung. Gerne wieder.
Comodidad total
"Die Schuhe sind sehr schön,  aber für mich etwas zu schmal. Die Qualität ist sehr hervorragend."
Muy buen product
I took the 7W and it is very comfortable.  Fits the size and it's perfect with my orthotics.
"Love the look, good with the fit. Great arch support."
Perfect fit and so comfortable!! I love Naturalizer shoes stylish and comfortable all in one !!
"Bonitos zapatos, primera vez que un zapato de mi talla  7 ,me queda apretado a pesar de tener un pie delgado"
Ordered wide width and it is too snug and shoes are hard to walk in
Extremely tight
"Traumhaft schöne Mädchen Sandalen, sehen in natura noch viel schöner aus als auf dem Foto. Meine Tochter ist begeistert, die Sandalen sind bequem zu tragen und lassen sich dank Klettverschluss wunderbar am Fuß anpassen. Meine Tochter hat etwas breitere Füße, diese Schuhe sind gut geeignet. 👍"
I was sent old worn out shoes.
Sehr schöne Sandalen - unsere Kleine mochte sie auf Anhieb. Passt zu Kleid oder auch zur Hose. Durch die zwei Klettverschlüsse prima an den Fuß anzupassen. Angenehme Innensohle. Vielen Dank!!
I really love the shoes
Die Bestellung kam pünktlich die Schuhe sehe gut aus aber leider sind die etwas zu klein ausgefallen aber sonst zufrieden
Die Sandalen passen wie gewünscht.Bequemes Fußbett und gute Verarbeitung.
Gute Sandale mit „biegsamer“ Sohle. Ideal für Kleinkinder.
"Super bequeme Sandalen, und trotzdem fest, um auch vernünftig spielen und laufen zu können"
Alles super
"Están muy padres, los compre a un precio bastante bueno 600$ mexicanos en el buen finMe encantaron son bonitos cómodos y 100% originales.Los recomiendo para quien quiera andar cómodo"
Comfy and no sweat
Love these!!!
"Bought these for a trip involving a lot of walking. They're comfy, fit well and are lightweight. Easy to get on and off. I walked all over Disney World for 5 days and never got a blister or chafing. My feet only began to hurt on the last day. I like these so much I'll buy another pair."
Very comfortable.
They fit good and make my feet look smaller (that's a women thing)The other items are Xmas gifts  🎁 I'll let you know after Xmas how well my family and friends like them.
I bought these sneakers for my granddaughter in Texas.  She said she loves the sneakers!  I'm pleased that she loves them!
Really  cool.My wife likes  it
"super comfy and cute! love them so much! and cheap! for the price they are amazing, i walk 1 hour every other day and these help make my feet last <3"
"These are sooooo comfortable, and beautiful.  I love them, I now have four pairs!"
Excelente y cómodo.
"Comodissimo, misura precisa e adatto a molte occasioni, da averne più di un paio"
"They came quickly and to the door, good fit, lighter than other Tevas that I have bought, but they are good. You can swim in them and so can walk on the rocks to the water, which is great in Malta."
Calzado perfecto para todo tipo de actividades.
"For those that have had TEVA sandals before, you know what to expect. The quality is good and the sandals are durable. They are a very basic design, with just a plank of rubber for the sole, and nylon strapping for the straps. It is comfortable enough to wear all day and after some time the sole will mold to your foot. They are a great river shoe or something to keep your feet protected but a bit more sturdy than some flip flops."
I suggested these to my boyfriend for our Cancun trip. He didn't have a sandal just slides. He enjoyed the fit and liked the color. They are great for walking around and water activities.
"Wonderful sandals, great quality, awesome colors, and very comfortable"
"Ordered these for my son, but I want a pair for myself now. They’re super lightweight and comfortable. Great fit. He loves them too!"
I've bot other Teva sandals and liked them but this shoe looked as if was a knock-off.
"Good fit, very light and comfortable EDC sandal"
"Excelente calidad, justo lo que estaba buscando, fueron compradas para mi hermano que solo usa esa marca y salieron a un muy buen precio."
"I got these on sale, such a great deal. They fit a half size bigger so keep that in mind. I'm very happy with the overall quality of the boots, good construction and good comfort. Can't wait to hop on the bike to really put them through their paces."
Great Boots
"Very happy with the HD boots, this are nice to ride on my motorcycle, goes with the style. Affordable price"
Parfait
Excelente
Bottes de moto
"Of the choices on fit, I had to choose ""Somewhat Small""...HOWEVER; if you do not have a tall foot (high in-step or 'club' foot), these boots fit perfectly. I wear size 9 1/2 boots...and these ARE 9 1/2 boots. My issue is the clearance at the top of my feet---pretty tight and taking a while to break in; so just be aware of that if you have a tall foot. That is my own problem. If I had a chance to try them on before buying, I MAY have gone a half a size up if it meant the top of the boot was more comfortable, but it's too hard to tell without physically comparing the two sizes.These boots get 5 stars, because (aside from my tight at the top issue) everything about the boots screams quality. First of all; I've always been a fan of Wolverine's, and that's who makes them (their web address is stamped on the bottom of the boot). Secondly, the materials, stitching, build, weight, and looks are all flawless on the pair I received. And last, but not least, these boots (for me any way), are so cool they give you a 'cool confidence' when you put them on...kept clean, they can be worn for any occasion from weddings & funerals, to Rock concerts and Rodeos.By the way; leather is not water proof (never has been, never will be)...best thing to do to make them as water ""resistant"" as possible, is to get some Mink Oil or any other leather treatment product, and treat them. They will repel water better, and last longer.I DO ride a motorcycle...but I don't think you have to be a motorcycle rider to own these boots. If you like good quality boots, buy a pair."
"So the actually boot is good, seems to be built well, pretty comfortable,  and for being a saftey shoe, the toe box is roomy and doesnt cramp my toes. My issue is buying shoes online. The fist boots i bought were to big, so i had to return them, however there wasnt an option to return and get a different size! I had to start a return, which by the way took almost 4 weeks to get my money back, then buy ANOTHER pair of boots in a different size. These fit better, but are still a bit too loose, but honestly i cant any longer because i meed saftey boots for work. That wardrobe plane they offer didnt work for me because amazon does not accept debit cards on that service."
"Only had for one day so far, but have had them on for 10 hours  and my feet feel great. Fit fine right out of the box. Put some mink oil on last night for water proofing and with the steel toe my company covers part of the cost as I can wear them for safety boots as well as riding boots. I don't believe I will be invoking the 30 day comfort guarantee. Real nice boots for any price, but this is a great price. **** Less than 2 months and the leather is like ""peeling"". They have never been scuffed but there's like a thin shin peeling on the toe of both boots. I tried polishing to seal them better and the slightest buffing caused the top layer of the leather to wrinkle and tear. Just the thinnest layer. Still the most comfortable boots I've ever worn! Lets see what they will do."

"Vaya por delante que el producto en sí está muy bien, es una muy buena zapatilla, pero os cuento mi caso y es que de primeras yo me equivoqué al pedir la talla, pedí un 42, y me mandaron una talla más, un 43, me puse en contacto con atención al cliente y me hicieron una devolución y las volví a pedir, esta vez la talla correcta, un 41, pero me llegó una talla 42, vuelvo a ponerme en contacto con  atención al cliente y me hacen un cambio y me mandan otras zapatillas y llega....otra vez el 42, vuelvo a ponerme en contacto con atención al cliente, me hacen una devolución y las vuelvo a comprar (un 41) y me vuelve a llegar un numero 42.....así hasta en 4 ocasiones me ha llegado un número más del pedido...he desistido y ya no las he vuelto a comprar, prefiero perder el buen precio al que las compraba a estar esperando y que me vuelvan a venir mal"
"Las zapatillas son igual q en la foto, pero ni siquiera las he puesto pq pedí 42 , sabiendo q tallan pequeño y uso 41'5.Y me han mandado el 43. Después de 3 devoluciones siguen mandando el 43."
"Ein toller Hallenschuh, ich selber spiele Handball und war sofort begeistert von Stabilität in Kombi mit Dämpfung, springen ist damit echt gut"
Va bene ma prendete mezza taglia in più del normale perché calza stretta
"Lo recomiendo totalmente, calidad precio 👌"
Las zapatillas son preciosas y seguramente muy cómodas
Genial
To my surprise the liner comes out and I’m super happy about that. They seem like they’ll be really warm and I’m hoping they hold up to the -40° they advertise because where we live we do often see those temperatures in the winter. However I feel the regular price is quite steep for toddler shoes that they may very likely grow out of half way through the season.
"Our kid loves these boots. Perfect for Canadian winters! They are warm and waterproof. They have a removable liner, perfect for drying them out in case snow gets in or if you want to wash them. A worthwhile investment!"
"These fit true to size and can be worn with or without socks.  Great for light hiking and creek crossing, they are extremely comfortable and dry relatively quickly.  My only complaint is the treads on the bottom started breaking off after only a couple of uses, so I wouldn't advise using them on pavement or rock too much.  Great traction on soft trail surfaces and pretty good on slippery wet rocks."
"I bought these for my 3-year-old. They are an excellent boot. They do up easily with velcro strap and drawstring at the top and are easy to get the snowpants over. No complaints from the toddler about warmth and they have a nice liner which is easy to take out to dry the boots. What I like about these compared to others I considered buying him is that they are waterproof and warm without being extra bulky, so he can easily run around in the snow."
Great product and work very well.
"Still just December here in Quebec, but my girl is happy.Edit: they lasted the winter. Not a single complaint even on the coldest days. Would purchase again!"
"Ive had merells before and I love them but this shoe was not made well. I have a tough hike coming up and I bought these to train for it and I took it on ONE 10 mile hike and the bottoms were worn down completely and one sole was coming off. The lettering inside the shoe was completely erased but that's just aesthetic, the worrisome part was the soles coming off after one hike. I had my shoes for one week and they looked like I had them for 6 years. This shoe did not perform and I would never purchase these again. I returned them and bought different Merrells"
"These boots may pass the waterproof test in the snow, but slush and rain will leave you with a wet liner every single time. They’re warm though, when they stay dry."
"I actually bought this product in a different place, size 8 which felt good but a little bit bigger than my usual size 7.5. When I saw it was available in 7.5 on Amazon I ordered it here..and couple days later I received size 8. I returned it with the reason “Wrong item was sent” and a note asking for the exchange..and a few days later I received again size 8. At that point I gave up and didn’t have time to request it again before my hiking trip. Size 8 turned out to be great for me. The shoes are very light, breathable, with good grip. On the photo they are after a week of hiking, washed and look like new."
"Well made product and a reasonable price point. Great vendor, fast shipper!"
I only had one dislike. A half size larger was substituted without my consent.  I am an athletic person and this makes a very large problem in the performance of the shoes.
I ordered these for my 5 year old son and found them to be a full size too small. They also have a more narrow fit than other boots. Once I sized up they were great. Very warm and they seem quite durable
Good quality children size 4 snow boots
J'adore ces bottes mais malheureusement elles ne font pas à mon enfant car il a le pied légèrement bombé sur le dessus et cette botte est étroite sur son dessus donc elles ne conviennent pas à tous. Dommage car j'aime le model.
Je les est retourner car elle étais trop petite pour mes fille mes elle étais magnifique et de super qualité
"cercavo proprio queste scarpe e l'offerta è stata imperdibile. Prodotto arrivato integro, nei tempi, inscatolato perfetto con all'interno lo scontrino fiscale (del negozio), le scarpe mai provate totalmente nuove. Conoscevo già il prodotto e sapevo il numero da prendere considerate che porto un 38 di scarpa mentre di Saucony oscillo tra 40 e 40.5, davvero soddisfatta."
I loved the price and fast delivery
"I thought  they were brighter in colour I use them for walking, fitness and spinning good support"
Son muy buenos pero para entrenamientos cortos
Muy cómodos
"Producto de buena calidad y sin detalles, es un modelo básico de la marca pero cumple con su función, mejoraron bastante con las plantillas que ahora manejan. Talla acorde a la tabla."
Using for work
Tal cual vienen en la foto! Están realmente perfectos! 😍
Ottima scarpa
"Muy bonitos, lleva como 3 puestas i ya se están descosiendo"
"I purchased a size 9.5 to wear walking, hiking, and maybe light running while on my Camino de Santiago journey.  I normally wear an 8.5 to a 9. My smallest and biggest toes were visible through the side fabric of the footbox because they are so small. The padding under the ankle was so tight that it was painful, even after loosening the shoe laces. These are by far the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever tried on."
Son prefectos
"I've been a longtime Saucony customer. This particular pair looks the same as the other styles and is comfortable in the same way but there is practically no arch support. If you use your own orthotics, you shouldn't have any complaints, especially at this price point."
Fit as expected.  Easy for a 4 yr old to put on.  Good quality.
Absolutely the worst shoe as far as comfort goes. Okay support. Looks cute. Huge let down on comfort. It actually felt like I had no cushion at all between the shore and the floor. Totally missed the mark on this one Saucony!
My kids love the shoes and think the dinosaur print is very cool
The shoes are comfortable. My daughter loves to wear them all the time. I also love the paw print.
Fake shoes
Good shoes for the price
My daughter asked for Osiris sneakers for Christmas but gave no other hints as to style.  I saw these and ordered them.  She absolutely loves them.  They came with purple and black laces and a very stylish.
"Styling shoes, my 17 year old daughter loves them!  A great way to begin the new school year is with a pair of fun new sneakers.  These shoes slide on and off easily and they are comfortable for walking around campus."
"If your a runner or workout exerciser, these are the most comfortable shoes for those activities.I am a big Under Armor fan but these have me over the top in love with my runs!!"
Comfortable and goes with everything walking shoes. Lots a room in toe and ball area.
For exercising
Perfect fit! And very comfortable to run!
I have bought this brand before and found it was great for the 4e width I need. This boot is tight so if you need 4e be prepared. It also doesn’t keep your feet warm after an hour outside. I wouldn’t buy this boot again.
"I have short and very wide feet and it is very difficult to find any womens shoes and boots in 4e. Originally ordered in 6.5 extra extra wide (4e) from a different store. It was pinching at the part where the rubber is sewn with the leather so they went back. I was very happy that I found the same pair here on Amazon so I ordered a 7-4e. The half size does make a difference. It does not pinch, but I would like a little more room for even just a regular pair of socks. I cannot wear a 7.5 otherwise it would look like clown shoes on me. I'm hoping they stretch once I've broken them in. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because of the fit. I don't believe they are an actual 4e, they feel like any other 7 wide in stores."
"Besides fit, one of the most important features of a winter/snow boot is how warm it keeps your feet. My feet are blocks of ice in these within minutes of going outside here in Vermont. I do not recommend, unless your choosing a boot purely for aesthetics."
"I really like these boots. They’re easy to get into and comfortable, unlike the Bean boots I ordered after my cheap but amazingly warm and comfortable Kmart boots cracked from over 25 years of use. They do run small though, so I ordered a 12ww. My usual size is from 10 1/2 - 11 depending on the shoe. I have very wide feet so I always go for the widest option."
"These boots are very nice but WAY too small. I wear a 10.5 EE, (nobody makes a 10.5 anything) so I ordered an 11 4E to allow for thicker socks. I could barely get my bare foot in the boot. These will be going back unfortunately."
The boots are perfect for rain or snow.  They keep me dry and warm.  I just wish they ran a little bit wider.  I like to slop in my boots so that I can wear thick winter socks.
I love these boots! Can’t wait for the snow. They fit perfectly.
"I love the shoes, the style. I wish the part that meets the rubber was a bit wider...to push my foot in hurts. Managed to get my foot in it...may need to send it back and go even more wider."
"Todos los pares que he comprado de esta marca, han sido del mismo número y en todas las veces han calzado perfecto.Son muy confortables y se ven bien.El precio lo valen.Espero sean duraderos como los últimos que tuve."
un  de mais 2 souliers avait un cordon avec un big noeud j ai du couper le cordon tellement le noeuf était serré et erreur de couture pas ma meilleure achat
"Très contant, bonne pointure, j'avais une paire plus vieille et même grandeur. Très satisfait."
Super cómodos y ligeros
"Me quedo Perfecto con mi talla, son muy cómodos a pesar de que tienen plataforma y se ven muy lindos."
I did t know it was a slip on type of shoe which makes it too tight. On a good side it's very comfortable while walking. Like your on a cloud.
Absolutely loved these shoes! They arrived earlier than expected which was even better. The colors are so vibrant just as the picture. They’re super comfortable and not heavy at all!
"I like how it looks, and the softness, but it is  narrower than I am used to, and feels a little tight!But it is a very durable, nice looking shoe. It feels like you have a soft step."
I'm happy with it and fit me perfectly very comfy
"Der Artikel war viel zu groß, wurde mit kostenlosem Rückversand zurückgenommen, aber dann nur mit 5 Cent rückerstattet. Absolute Unverschämtheit: nie wieder dieser Verkäufer!"
Très confortable pour le travail !
"Nice sneakers, but not new, as seen in the photo - they have already been used. They are small in size about half the size, my wife usually wears 5.5, but this model is small for her. I think size 6 would be just right."
I ordered these shoes for work. I’m on my feet 9-10 hours a day. I always wear reebok and never had a problem. However I ordered my normal size 7 and these were more like a 6 narrow. Beeare it would have cost me more time and money to return these. I wore them for 20 minutes and had to take them off. $74.00 lost and the shoes are still in the box in my closet. I’m starting to believe these aren’t actual reebok but knock offs
"Had this type before, so thought it would be same size and same comfort, but not so. Would not buy again."
"I love these shoes! I have plantar fasciitis and arthritis in my rt big toe, and I couldn’t survive on my feet at work without these awesome shoes!I work in pathology in a major hospital and these are the only shoes that work for me!!! I also use a different insole in these shoes."
They tore after wearing them twice.
Great fit and very comfortable with the proper support for casual wear and walking.
Perfect shoes for running
Buen producto
"The Ninja/Elf shoes I've been looking for all of my life. Go a size up, though (ninjas and elves aren't known for their great size).  The nemiziz with the partial built in sock I use for hiking.  The riggers of soccer not being so different from other activities means they are light weight with partial support at the ankle that keep rocks and dust out.  The wrap design supports the foot at weird angles as well.  I just wish they built one with a sole more for minimal trail running, but these currently do the trick."
Nice shoes. Definitely small by half a size. Go a half a size up and you'll be pleased.
El modelo es muy lindo solo que si lo pides de tu talla te quedará grande
My son likes it
"Finally a fabric sneakers with zipper! Very versatile, soft, fabric, memory foam, comfortable, universal [w/o sneakers], washable, sturdy...for me standing for 10-12 hrs on my feet, this is a must! Like them!"
Great value for money and decent quality
"I wore this shoe twice before the insole starting riding up toward my arch and when i tried patting it back down, it stuck tight in a bunched up position. They are very painful to use like this. It is like walking with a wad of cardboard in your arch and the heel is decompressed because of the lack of insole. What terrible quality."
"A bit tight. I bought one size bigger because my size is way too tight. If you find your right size, this kicks do their work, they are pretty good. Really like them"
"Ordered these twice and both times received the wrong size, so I gave up.  If they sent the right size, I might have really liked them - they're very cute."
I really regret purchasing this shoe. The laces are horrendous to tie and are made from very cheap material. Save yourself some money and look elsewhere
"I first ordered these shoes in size 8, and the fit was at lest a whole size too big. I ordered a second pair in 7.5, and was sent a 6.5 instead. Very disappointing."
Fit a little small
"I showed my Sister and her foot is a bit larger than mine.  They were a perfect fit, so I gave them to her.  I reordered myself another black pair. I already have a white pair.  All Anne Klein shoes and even this New iflex sneaker , fits my foot as if she (Anne Klein) made them especially for me.  Perfectly for me.  Thank you Anne Klein, I love your styles.Especially the Patten leather wedged dress shoes. Thank you, Again.  y.jones"
The sole started to come off after the first use
"Great quality and sneakerability!  Shoes came too large in my regular size. So sad, as I loved them. Sold out of next lower size. Would’ve exchanged, but forced to just return."
"I have an older version of this zip up sneaker that I love. This new Gen style..isca miss for ne, sadly. Will be returning."
Súper cómodos la talla es tal cual . Gracias a @inversioneslala por traerlos a Venezuela …
Really nice shoes!
Great quality and fit perfectly!
It’s really light on the feetDoesn’t cause any discomfort at the heel like other shoesIt gives you that spring
"Das Design ist witzig. Vom Material darf man nicht viel erwarten, ist halt Kunstleder, wenn Schuhe zu weit ausfallen, bekommen sie auf dem Spann Gehfalten, das zermürbt das Material und es fängt an zu reißen.Der Schuh fällt weit aus. Keine gute Passform. Hab ihn zurückgesendet.  Das ging reibungslosZwei Sterne für das Design."
"Il prodotto è ben fatto come plantare ed è confortevole nella calzata, unica pecca dopo una settimana un occhio dello squalo si è staccato come un adesivo...adesso lo squalo è sguercio 😑"
"Hallo... der Schuh ist sehr schön... habe ihn gleich 2 x gekauft einmal f die Schule u einmal f zuhause....allerdings löst sich relativ schnell das Gesicht, bei uns schon nach 2 Wochen, was sehr schade ist... da dies ja gerade das süße an dem Schuh war. Ist also nur aufgeklebt. Sonst ist der Schuh robust."
"Muy cómodas, las usa nuestro hijo de 12a q nuuunca quiere llevar nada en los pies cuando está en casaY para mí sorpresa se las pone desde q entra en casa sin ni recordárselo!Le encantan"
Ein sehr schöner Schuh sowohl für Zuhause als auch für unterwegs. Angenehm zu tragen und ist absolut nicht schwer. Ich werde diesen auf jeden Fall nochmals kaufen.
"Ben fatte, comode. Vestono normale. Il ho preso un 39."
"Gleiche Größe bestellt wie die offenen, aber für die Schule dann doch über den Winter geschlossene gekauft. Preisleistung war ok. Etwas eng über den Spann, durch die schnalle aber noch zu regeln. Mal sehen wie lange der Fuß reinpasst!"
Tolle etwas ausgefallene Schuhe. Nehme sie als Hausschuhe. Passen gut. Versand und Preis war gut
"Schuhe sind sehr schön, sind aber etwas eng. Mein Sohn liebt sie."
Witziges Schuhwerk für Haifans.
"Der Schuh macht echt was her, die lose Sohle hab ich rausgenommen, weil sie für mich unbequem war, habe stattdessen Barfuß Sohlen genommen. Größe 41 passt perfekt. Die Verarbeitung ist top, Högl eben!!!!. Der Schuh ist  leicht vom Gewicht und sehr bequem zu tragen."
"Dieser Schuh ist echt ein Hammer, was Qualität und passender Sitz bedeutet.Und ich weiss wovon ich rede. Habe viele Probleme bei Schuhen, was Sitz betrifft.Aber hier, alles sehr gut. diese Marke ist bei mir gespeichert.Danke."
"Der Schuh ist sehr hochwertig verarbeitet, leicht und bequem. Innen und außen Leder, die Innensohle lässt sich herausnehmen für lose Einlagen. Leider quietscht meine Orthese beim Laufen sehr durch die Leder-Innenseite, so dass ich die Schuhe schweren Herzens zurückgebe. Für alle anderen: absolute Kaufempfehlung!"
"Too big. I ordinary wear size 38,5 Högl.  These I should have in 38."
"Der Titel sagt alles, Högl eben!"
Schnitt ist zu breit 😏
I ussually wear size 40 but this one are really big-
Great and confortable!
"Like a lot of volleyball shoes, this one kind of squeezes your heel. That being said it does stay in place when jumping. The white really popped for about the first 3 days then rapidly turned yellow. Very breathable though."
"The shoe fits as expected. However, it has a clear outer casing that feels like plastic and it makes the shoe look dirty (off-white), compared to the White Adidas Stripes. I wouldn’t recommend purchasing  them for this reason."
"My daughter had to have black volleyball shoes for school.  She liked the ones with the black stripes better than the white,  for an all black look.  They fit perfectly and she likes them.  She said they are a little on the heavy side though."
Very attractive and sturdy shoe.
Fits perfectly. Very comfortable on long walks.
They are too narrow and they run about a half size too small.  They are also very stiff and not comfortable
i need a return label to return these shoes sent to me
Perfect
"While other reviews indicated better to go up a size, I went up only a half size and a bit loose.I am just tightening the strap so ok I guess. Also i have wide feet and no issue there.I don't think these shoes would make sense for a narrow foot. Other than size issues, shoes are great."
"I am a ballroom and line dancer and have had much difficulty finding shoes that fit, have the low cuban heel I want, are comfortable, well made and reasonably priced. I have ordered and returned more dance shoes that I'm willing to admit to. Dance shoe stores in my area are scarce and carry a limited variety. I found a store not in my area that carries Very Fine dance shoes and the shoe I wanted but, they had to be ordered. I tried on the shoe I wanted in a higher heel in the store and then ordered it in the heel I did want and 1/2 size up from my street shoe. The shoes were late in arriving and I checked Amazon for them and there they were ... and cheaper than what I would have paid at the store. They are perfect! They are very comfortable, fit my narrow heel and are wide enough at the toes. They come with a shoebag, a wire brush to clean the suede on the soles, and a shoe freshener packet. I have received many compliments on them. I will be ordering a second pair to have as back up in case the company stops making them. I highly recommend this dance shoe!"
I have danced for over 15 years. This is a very comfortable shoe for a wide foot. The problem is it is manmade material and the shoe causes blisters if you don't wear socks. Even then it might cause blisters if your prone to getting them. The size fit just as I expected. It is very sad shoe makes don't use all leather when making shoes. Had I not gotten a blister I could have danced all night.
Comfy dance shoes! I went half size up & it was perfect. My regular size was too tight.
"Great dance shoe for West Coast Swing. I can wear them all night long, and I dan't several hours. I use an insert, but I do that with all my dance shoes. They hold up pretty well, too. This is my second pair."
I like this shoe - its very comfortable and provides a lot of support. I ordered them for a performance - don't know if I will keep it (depending if I can wear a flat shoe to perform) but otherwise I think they are very comfortable and stable. I also think they are true to size. My street size is 6 and this size 6 fits very well.
"Comfort is great and they are beautiful.  Took another pair to dance in case these needed to be broken in over time, but did not need the extra shoes."
I expected to have to 'break' these shoes in. They did not rub anywhere. loved them!
"I have been searching for dancing shoes with no or a low heel. These are perfect and very comfortable. Unfortunately, they were a bit short for me as my toe was hitting the end. I will check their website again to see if I can go up a size. Great service from the company for the return also."
"These are my favorite dancing shoes. It's hard to find a pretty, relatively low heeled, suede bottom shoe! I've worn these now for several months and they are great."
"Como siempre. Los números grandes como el mío, siempre son medio más. Por eso no entiendo que otros compradores digan que son pequeños."
el tallaje alomejor si es un poco justo porque son estrechas pero para mi son muy comodas. Llegaron en el plazo y todo correcto. De momento muy bien con ellas
Este tipo de zapatillas son muy cómodas. Lo único es que son un poco caras.
"El acabado y los materiales perfectos, pero pedí el numero que llevo habitualmente y no se si sera por el acolchado que llevan pero son ligeramente mas estrechas, pedí medio numero mas y van perfectas, el servicio de amazon al realizar el cambio perfecto como siempre"
Geniales
My son wears a 4.5-5. I ordered a 5/6 & couldn’t even get them on his feet. I’d recommend sizing up at least 2 sizes!!
"Pedi medio número mas ya que lei que asics talla un poco justo y acerté.Van como un guante,muy comodas y bien chulas."
"Estoy empezando a utilizarlos y parecen cómodos y confortables para el invierno. Creo que tallan algo menos que otros calzados similares, concretamente me da la sensación de ser algo más estrechos. Buena compra"
Si no quieres tener problemas pide media talla o una talla más. Son muy estrechas! Pero son preciosas y ligeras.
"Le uniche  scarpe che riesco a tenere a lavoro, cammino tantissimo e ne ho prese di diversi colori, da provare, non ve ne pentirete"
Soy fan de las zapatillas de deporte y estas son comodísimas y bonitas. Aconsejables para andar. Van perfectamente con vaqueros.
"Supercoole Boots, flottes design, warm und wasserfest, klasse Jungs-Winterschuhe"
"Ich kann zum Schuh in seiner Funktion nichts sagen, möchte jedoch allen Kaufinteressenten mit einem etwas breiteren Fuß mitteilen, dass auch leider bei diesem Schuh kein Platz an den Seiten zu finden ist. Das Obermaterial ist auch nicht sehr flexibel, es knittert eher. Optisch aber eine gute Mischung, nicht zu bunt."
Passt und fühlt sich sicher und bequem an. Ballgefühl ist auch gut.
tres bien
"Beim Auspacken ist mir die Verarbeitung sofort aufgefallen. Vom Gummi der die Schuhzunge vorm wegrutschen verhindert. Über Lederqualität und vernähen zum ordentlicher Einlage und beigelegtem Form-Einschübe.Schade finde ich das diese Schuhe nur in Schwarz gibt. Braun oder Oliv wäre interessant.Richtig stramm kann man diese Schuhe nicht verschließen. Aber sie sitzen sehr gut und man hat nicht das Gefühl sie wären zu locker. Auch habe ich nicht das Gefühl das meine Füße wie ""Hufe"" aussehen. Sie haben eine normale Form.Die Sohle ist relative Glatt. Ich werde sehen wie sie im Winter sind.Gute Schuh für Leute mit breite- oder geschwollene Füße.Ich hoffe sie halten eine Weile."
Dieser Schuh ist perfekt für die  die verbundene Füße haben . Sind weich und flexibel einstellbar durch Klettverschluss . Werden sicherlich noch ein paar bestellen .
"Der Schuh ist genauso wie vorgestellt. Sehr weit dehnbar, sehr weit und optisch recht unauffällig. Wir sind begeistert. Haben die Schuhe bestellt, da der Fuß meines Vaters immer enorm anschwillt. Haben seine normale Schuhgröße 43 gekauft und er passt trotz klumpfuss"
"Ich finde die Schuhe toll. Habe Lymphödem und zwei verschieden große Füße. Das lässt sich damit kompensieren. Eine Sache wäre allerdings toll, wenn die Sohle weicher wäre. Man kann nicht alles haben."
Sehr selten das ein Schuh sogar größer ausfällt als angeboten.Auch die Weite ! Sehr weit (und für mich sehr angenehm).Es kann aber sein das man eine Nummer kleiner kaufen muss.
"I ordered a pair of these shoes for my husband who has swollen feet. He absolutely loves how easy it is to put the shoes on and take them off, how light and roomy they are and how easy to walk in them. Excellent product and quality service from Amazon."
"etwas breit.Klettverschluss nicht umgelenkt, daher festes schließen schwierig."
Passt sehr gut für orthopädische Füsse Hammerzehen
sehr gut
"rasche Lieferung, der Schuh passt perfekt, weiches Leder, keinerlei Druck auf den Fuß oder Zehen"
I bought these for my 8 year old. She loves them. We seen these at ASICS outlet store for 55.00. That was a little too expensive for shoes that have been discontinued. So I went on Amazon and found these almost half the price. She says there comfortable but a little hard to put on. Might need a shoe horn.
My kid LOVES these shoes. They are very comfortable and my daughter has no problem running and jumping in them. She's been wearing them for over a month and hasn't torn them up... Yet. Hopefully they maintain this level of durability. I'm impressed.
My girl loves these and quickly replaced her other tennis shoes. So far they are holding up well and she definitely can tear through shoes pretty quickly!
These sneakers were not comfortable on my feet at all.  They felt too narrow and thin.  The ASICS Gel Lyte sneakers are far more comfortable and stylish (IMO).
For some reason my left shoe feels like I have a rock on the side of my shoe when I run but when I take it off there’s nothing there.
"Beautiful sneakers,  little to narrow.Keeping it."
Lots if complements. Ordered size 5.5 and wear women’s 7
"This shoe is beautiful and seems to be of a very good quality, but it didn't fit my boy it was too small and narrow."
"These are amazing running shoes! They fit perfectly, and they are so comfortable! Definitely worth the money."
"It's a little bit tight near the toes even though I ordered my usual size, but overall they fit well and the shoes are good quality."
These are slides not the shoes in the picture at all!!
I did not receive what was shown in the picture instead i received slides
I ordered a new shoes with a good price.I received a used shoes today.Even I check again my invoice it show's I ordered a New shoes.If from the beginning the seller indicated the item is used one then I would not disappointment.There is no inner paper inside of shoes as a brand new one.Bottom of shoes is dirty and some foreign matter is stuck on there.Shoe Lace tied is not the same left and right.It makes me so frustrating.
"One time worn and so far so good. Snug fit, but comfortable. I’m using them for hard court tennis game and I’m in need ankle support and the tennis shoe 3/4 height shoe selection is very limited. They fit well with my ankle support straps on. I had to do a light work to get my feet into them but once that’s accomplished my feet were in the shoes felt great."
"I purchased these shoes to play pickleball only. They have only been worn on the cement court. After wearing them about 60 times over the past 6 months, the soles are done. They are super comfortable and stable, but do not seems to stand up to a cement court. I like them soo much, I still may spend the money to purchase another pair. Just wish they were a little more durable."
Work great for racquetball.  Durable and great traction.
Was a birthday present for grandson - he loved them!
These shoes were mislabeled. Advertised as WIDE. Shoe was tight to the point that it hurt just putting them on.
Bought these for my son and he loves them. Switched to these from cleats. He says they are Much more comfortable than cleats.
Comfortable and perfect for what I bought for
I did not like the design that didn't have a separate tongue. it made it difficult to get the shoe on.
Great pair of turfs. My son wears them for Box on a very low turf “carpet.” Wide gives a great fit.
Das Preis/Leistungsverhältnis war sehr gut für diesen super Sneaker. Passen nicht nur gut sondern sehen auch gut aus.
Gutes Markenprodukt zu sehr günstigen Preis
"alles super , eine  numer kleiner nehmen !!!"
"Good comfy affordable shoes, shipped fast"
"I have back problems as well as foot issues. I cannot walk comfortably barefooted or even in most basic slip on shoes. I needed something that not only supported my feet, provided stability, but would also be comfortable to wear all day. I am retired and was looking for a shoe to slip on in the morning and wear all day around the house, outside doing yard work or to run and errand. These shoes have definitely made a difference. From the moment I put them on my back felt better, I was able to remain standing for a greater length of time and when I went to bed my feet and legs weren't throbbing from the stress of being on my feet. I love them...now I just have to see how long they'll last."
"These are absolutely amazing! I searched high and low for indoor footwear with good cushioning, traction and comfort that actually stayed on my foot after having surgery on both knees and was dissatisfied time after time UNTIL I FOUND THESE! As soon as I received these isotoner zens stretch satin slippers I didn’t want to take them off! (Now my only problem is having to buy another pair to wear on errands!!) They feel like a big bear hug for my feet! They have super soft cushioning, are very light weight, so so soft on the inside, have great traction on my wood and tile floors so I no longer feel the instability (and the pain that come with) of slipping ever so slightly while walking. Honestly the best things I’ve put on my feet in a very long time... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I normally wear a 7 1/2 or 8 depending on the shoe and I got an 8 that fits perfectly (without socks although I couldn’t imagine wearing socks with them as the entire inside is plush and cozy but not annoyingly so like some slippers) love, love, love!"
"These shoes are exactly what I needed because of aging sever arthritic feet where flexibility inhibits walking as I once did . Everything about them is the most comfortable, like keds were when we were young, washes beautifully, and aids in a very easy on and off format. However on asphalt the soft gripping sole which is a very big plus, must be considered to be dangerous on  certain surfaces as they grip and as in todays experiences, I  fell on my driveway hitting  my head and face ,badly bruised and realized the sole got stuck because of the texture of blacktop, that is pebbley, due to weathering. Dragging feet can happen with us all and that must be something to watch for with these shoes. Not a criticism but an aspect of how things are very beneficial but also need o be used with care..This aspect can be noticed by pushing  on the sole and indent it easily ..All in all a very difficult aspect of a perfect shoe but consider all limitations and be careful in them."
"Here's a great pair of slippers that don't look like slippers and goes beyond traditional slipper functionality.ISOTONER Zenz Women's Stretch Satin Slippers look like crisp espadrilles that  have a more cushy  sole that adds a slightly athletic look. Suitable to go outside in your garden or yard or even to the store with a casual pair of pants, these slippers are warm but breath and comfortable to wear.  I am impressed with these slippers. It comes in only 3 colors: black, gray and navy. I bought black and I think it looks very sophisticated for a slipper. It's definitely able to be seen by friends and family. It's a must  for visiting a spa, or traveling or going to a hospital.  The only think I am not happy about is that the colors are so boring and limited. Where are the bright colors that would make these perfect to wear  around the pool, or with casual shorts or capris?"
"I wear 8.5 in most shoes, except a 9 in running shoes. I found the 9 fit well, but my toes can not get any longer or they would not work. These shoes are so comfortable, I forgot to change out of them when I went shopping. I did not find they have enough support for the hours on my feet shopping on concrete floors. House and yard are fabulous. They keep your feet warm, so if sweaty feet are a concern for you, you may not be completely happy. I also washed them in washing machine on cold, low heat dryer. The puffed up about 2 inches thick. I was able to put my foot into them, but they are pretty tight. Still comfortable, but not the same shoe anymore."
"I'd been reluctant to wear a shoe for a slipper  but finally gave up on the latter: this shoe/slipper is so lightweight yet well structured, I'm thrilled; it slips easily on and off easily, but fits snugly when it should. I'm an 8.5/9 shoe and picked a 9. I wear very thick warm socks inside my slippers and was worried this wouldn't work; but somehow they stretch."
I absolutely LOVE these shoes!  The first pair I bought to try out as a slipper alternative for around the house because I have tile floors that were wrecking havoc on my body. I absolutely love them so much that I bought another pair to wear out and about. I’ve had several foot surgeries including some hardware. My feet are extremely happy in these shoes and they are so light you don’t even feel like your wear anything.  I highly recommend them!
"Just received this item.  After numerous trys and abject failures , this product is what I want.  A comfortable house slipper/shoe  that IS TRUE TO SIZE, that isn't too heavy, covered with fur, and that I can wear outside if necessary.  Thank you, Isotoner!"
"Originally I ordered the size 7 in the black, which is my usual size.  They felt tight in length, not width, but I thought they just needed to stretch a bit.  Nope.  A couple days later my big toes were still unhappy.  I decided to order the 8, and they are MUCH more comfortable.  I wear them with no show cotton sock liners, and love that I can wear these inside and also out running quick errands as they do not look like slippers.  The foam makes for a nice cushy feel, and they stay comfy all day.  Can't speak to longevity yet or how they wash."
"I have few other gola shoes, and I like them a lot. But the sizing is funny to figure out, I guess they are larger than US sizes. I'm 7, when ordered 7 from endless ( a long time ago)  it was 2 sizes too big. So when i ordered 5 it worked perfect.this purchase turned out to be too small, I ordered 5, which is 7 in US. So next time ill order 6 and hopefully that will work."
"This shoes are super nice, i'm loving them. The only problem if much is the color, the brown is not as dark as you see it in the picture, is a little lighter. Besides that i dont have any problem, the are very comfortable and pretty. They do come big so, i usually wear shoes size 9 and this are a bit loose, i really dont mind."
"I ordered a pair of blue and yellow shoes. They fit perfectly, and the quality is great too. sizes run a little big, if you are half size, buy smaller one. for example if you are 7 1/2 get size 7. they are very comfortable to wear and they have very nice shape and design. i'd recommend these shoes if you are a lover of european style"
It's a little narrow and hurt my foot at the widest part (at the big toe joint) but after a couple weeks it got broken into.  Very stylish and now comfortable shoe!  I had the green ones and wore them until there were holes in the soles so this is a nice replacment
"I am so disapointed. They are too small, too narrow, stiff and did not come with a packing slip so not sure how to return them as I can not wear them. They are a pretty colour, but unwearable."
Love them!!! So cute and comfortable!!!
"Gorgeous REAL VELVET color, almost a blue gray but not quite, just enough that it could cross over to blue clothing if needed, I ordered my usual 39, they rub a tiny bit at the heel but I have wide feet and I think these will be perfect once broken in, I can add a pad on the inside heels. I ordered them in pink too.  The insoles are very padded, not thin and cheap."
"Love these shoes, I also bought them in blue/gray, great fit, good quality and cushioning"
Love these comfie shoes!!!
Von der Optik her sehen die Schuhe sehr edel aus! Bin sogar schon auf die tollen Schuhe angesprochen worden! Hab sie eine Nummer große bestellt da ich Einlagen trage! Die Einlagesohlen der Schuhe selbst sind heraus nehmbar! Was natürlich in meinem Fall sehr praktisch ist!  Der Absatz ist im ganzen etwas höher was toll aussieht aber etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig ist! Aber ein angenehmes Tragegefühl! Der einzige Nachteil ist der Geruch! Da ich sehr geruchsempfindlich bin! Jeden anderer Schuh hätte ich deshalb zurück geschickt! Aber der Schuh gefällt mir trotzdem!
"Ganz hervorragend, wertige Optik und beste Verarbeitung...UND: toller Service durch Amazon..."
"Preis-Leistung passt sehr gut, Lieferung und Rücksendung hat tadellos funktioniert.Der Speaker passt hervorragend, werde ihn wieder kaufen!"
Passen super
Pointure habituelle. Très confortables et très chic.
"Update:  Yikes!!!  I ordered two pair of Bloch jazz shoes from the warehouse.  Two different sizes.  They looked the same to me upon arrival.  My granddaughter refused to wear the first pair she tried on yesterday evening.  That review is below.  Today she wanted to try the other pair.  They fit and she likes them.  Then she proceeded to show me how the two pairs are different.  The pair she likes have the Bloch logo inside the shoe.  The first pair she tried on did not have the Bloch logo.  The color was not quite identical and the seam lines are  not the same.  The toe on the unbranded shoes is gathered, not smoothly wrapped under the toe.  I would include pictures if that option was still available.  We received one pair that is NOT a Bloch jazz shoe.  In fact, it does not have any brand name on it anywhere.  The size is stamped where the logo should go inside the shoe.  I have updated my review to five stars.  The Blotch shoes are very nice.Original review:  My granddaughter has always loved her jazz shoes.  It was time to go bigger.  These are a different brand than I have purchased in the past.  I purchased these from the warehouse.  They fit.  BUT, the seam that goes around the arch and under her foot, was uncomfortable and she couldn't get them off fast enough.  She informed me they are uncomfortable and she will not wear them.  Perhaps they were returned to the warehouse because of a defect on the seam?  Or perhaps the seam placement makes this style less comfortable. They look fine to me and seem to be the correct size.  [These turned out to be another brand, not Bloch.]I have reordered jazz shoes in a different style for her to try.  Unfortunately, these will be returned.  The warehouse price was great.  I really wanted these to work.  Oh well."
"I ordered these for my daughter to take dance class, and like tap shoes, I heard these ran big. I guessed the same for both shoe types and ordered a size up. These definitely run large, to the point that you can see where her toes are and the edge of the shoe is flat. They’re not the easiest to get on and I’m worried if we size down much she’ll just outgrow them quickly, and she doesn’t seem to mind the extra toe space, so we’re making these work. Otherwise I’m happy with the quality, just hoping they make it to class at the rate she’s wearing them around the house!"
"Got them for my daughters jazz class.  The studio sells them at twice the price for the same exact shoes.  We tried shoes in the studio, so we knew what size to get.  My daughter wears a size 12 shoe with a little growing room and this is the same.  She has a little thicker foot, but not quite  a wide width and they are not too tight with socks.  If you have a thin foot, they would have been too big and we would have needed an 11 or 11.5 in the shoe."
"My daughter is between a 10.5 and 11 in little kids regular shoes and I ordered both sizes. They were both huge on her. Sized down again to a 10, smaller than her shoe size and still too large. Tried a 9.5 and they are still too long, but now too narrow to be comfortable. Seems like a quality shoe, just won’t fit well unless you have narrow feet."
These were purchased for a GD who is beginning jazz dance classes.  I read through many reviews and purchased two different brands of shoes.  I ordered a size 12 1/2 in this brand and the GD wears a size 13 in regular tennis shoes.  These fit just a tad long but the width is perfect and they do not slip off her feet.  She will hopefully be able to wear these the full year.  They appear to be well made and are soft and comfortable for her.
"This shoe is really narrow. However, the quality is great. My daughter wears a size 2 street shoe, and a 12 1/2 in this shoe. I was expecting this difference, but her previous shoe was not as difficult to get on. Would be impossible to slide on without tights on."
Super jazz are true to size. Do not size up. I had to return my first order because I  chose a half size bigger than her current jazz shoes from same brand. Had to return for her street size shoe.
My daughter dances in these endless hours and I have only needed to replace them as her feet grow. They are a great quality and a purchase I will continue to make as she dances throughout the years.
"The shoes were shipped in a zip lock bag! Ridiculous! As much as we pay for this shoe, it should've been in a box. Plus, the shoes is so tight and hard to put on. I even ordered one size up."
Great quality shoe. Love Bloch! Order one size smaller than street shoe size.
Nach nur 5 Monaten sind die Riemen an beiden Schuhen bereits eingerissen. Ganz schlechte Qualität! Keine Kaufempfehlung.
ottimo
ゼビオさんで購入しましたが一度開けているようで靴の中の詰め物が入ってなかった。ちょっとしたことだが気分が悪い。
すごく、かるくて、よかったですですが、履いてしたらへんの方がちょと、あいだがありました。それをなくしたらもっとかるくなると、おもいます
第一印象は軽い，走った感じも良いようです。
息子の部活用にこのスニーカーが欲しいとせがまれて買いました。走りやすいと喜んでいました！ありがとうございました。
Der Schuh wirkt billig. Er ist viel zu eng. Hat überhaupt nicht gefallen. Auf den Fotos sieht er schöner aus
Die Schuhe sind schick und bequem. Qualitativ machen sie einen hochwertigen Eindruck.
"Diese Pantolette war mir trotz richtiger Größe zu eng, die Innensohle zu hart und deshalb nich bequem für mich. Das Aussehen gefiel mir gut.Habe die Pantolette deshalb zurück geschickt."
Gerade für sie warmen Tage sind diese Schlappen wirklich sehr angenehm barfuß zu tragen. Sie passen wie erwartet und haben einen hohen Tragekomfort.
"Diese Pantoletten haben ein gutes Preis/Leistungsverhältnis, passen in der richtigen Größe und sind leicht und bequem."
Besser eine Nummer größer bestellen bei hohem Rißt!
"Schnelle Lieferung Qualität  Rieker halt. Für gute Qualität bekannt , bin sehr zufrieden 👍"
Super schuh guter Preis
Schöner Schuh
klasse
Puntualità nella consegnaProdotto Ottimo.
"Schöner leichter Sneaker. Leider etwas eng.. aber, ich lauf sie einfach ein :-) sehen echt super aus. Tolle Verarbeitung und echt leicht."
"I just tried them on to see that they are a little bit smaller than the expected. Ordered 36, but they fit more like 35 or 35.5. They are not something extraordinary and I dont know if I would keep them even if they fit"
Sono molto belle e comode anche se di calzata un pochino piccola. Secondo me coincide (la calzata) alla Saucony da donna.
Super produit conforme à mes attentes
"I ordered these a few months ago, and just hopped on today to see what other colors and styles are available. I love them. Super comfortable (they run on the large side of accurate. I am often a 6.5/7, and the 7 (US) is perfect for slipping on and off without untying). I always get complements on them - and my young adult kids have asked me where I got them, so I think that's a good sign. :) I bought the low top trainers in white / multi. They go with so many things. I'd give them a 10 star, if I could."
"These are a great color and look for the summer and spring. Like all Golas for me, they first fit a little tight and rub a little at the heal but it is a matter of breaking them in. Once broken in, they are extremely comfortable. The sizes on this website are US sizes."
These were a birthday gift for my daughter-in-law. And she loves them! She wore the same size she always wears. It was good. Good quality sneaker.
I am a size EU 39 and the 9 was a little too big but they weren’t large enough to return.
Excelente y cómodo.
"I was debating getting these shoes. After much back and forth with my self I decided to get them, and am I glad I did.1. They fit true to size2. They are super comfortable, light and stretchy3.  They came with little white ankle stockings....bonus4. They are not bad looking on at allThese are not supportive at all, eventhough I bought them primarily for the gym. I wouldn't do any type of high intensity activity in them. I don't think they would hold up under the pressure.I would definitely purchase another color, and I would definitely recommend these."
"Very comfortable. This is an attractive, comfortable walking shoe for summer.  They are mesh and would probably not do for cold or wet weather but they are great for warm and dry.  I have a small foot and athletic type shoe usually make my feet look likes Minnie Mouse's. |These are slim and weightless and look great. I've had many complements on them."
"These cute, lightweight sneakers are like wearing comfy slippers!  They don't have great support so I would not recommend using them for running or aerobics but I've been wearing them all day around the house and I have zero complaints!  If you wear them outside I would wait till warm weather as they are not waterproof nor do they insulate in any way.  Understand what you are purchasing-these are fashionable, comfy, casual shoes.  Not high-performance sneakers.  Fit true to size.  Am a 7.5, ordered a 7.5 and they fit perfectly.  I love these so much I have purchased 2 more pairs in different colours!  Great shoes for the price!"
"Just arrived (so cannot speak to durability yet), and I'm thrilled with these shoes!  They are incredibly comfortable, no sore spots or discomfort and the arch support is fantastic.  I was debating whether to buy these or the Dr. Scholl's Madison walking shoe.  I went with these because they were less expensive, boy am I glad I did!  They are super breathable and comfortable which is just what I need for an upcoming trip to NYC."
"I have Type 2 diabetes and my feet get very tender and hot in regular sneakers and they swell if I walk for a long time, these seem like they are going to be good for the first problem since they are very ventilated as for the feet swelling they are pretty stretchy so we'll see. I can't test them outside for now because it's winter and there is a lot of snow, but I wore them all day yesterday in the house and they were very comfy.The sockette that come with them have a seem down the middle so they are unusable for me because the seem irritate the sole of my feet."
I love wearing these for shopping trips because they feel so comfortable and very lightweight.
"It is definitely light, true to size and seems comfortable. However I had to return the pair because the soles are very narrow/slender compare to the typical brands i’m use to wearing."
Comfortable for a few months. But now loose on top of shoe. The elastic is not strong enough. Not anywhere near as comfortable as Sketchers.
I really like these shoes.  They offer more support than sandals.  They do run a wide.
Very comfy for walking at home. My wife was heavily pregnant when I bought these for her and her feet were swollen.she felt very comfortable walking in these for long distances.
"This model is very very tight even whe it is my usual size. As you can see, i have 5 pairs of Reebok shoes, 3 in pictures 2 at home and only the flashfilm 3 are very very tight all my shoes are the same size US 12.Follow up: Double checking on ebay i found these shoes are designed for women. am dissatisfied"
Pequeño talla incorrecta
"Talla justa, tal cual las imágenes."
"Estaba especialmente feliz de recibir este modelo ya que como es importado espere varios días, y oh sorpresa! Talla equivocada! Es la segunda vez que me pasa en productos de importación:/... Lo tuve que regresar ! El modelo está súper bonito :("
"I do workout videos several times a week.  I like to make sure that my shoes can stand up to all the moves.  These shoes fit perfectly and are great to workout in.  I love the longer tongue on the shoes-I know that sounds funny, but they protect the ankle area more than most shoes do."
Comfy love it

Value for money
Perfekt. Gerne wieder

ottimo acquisto! super rappporto qualita' prezzo e si sta veramente comodi
perfette
Most amazingly comfortable shoe I own! Stands up to my nikes. Got these because I go through white shoes (uniform) and need something cheap that i can throw away after a few months due to the nature of my work. They come clean very easily. I have no arch in my foot and my feet are very wide! These do not leave me with any foot or leg pain!
"My young adult daughter was sulking, as usual, from life's usual bummers. But when she saw these new peach shoes that I bought for her, she got a hard-to-hide smile. And I later heard her leaping and running through our big old home! So we got a bright on delivery day of these jazzy, yet comfortable, shoes."
"I work 12 hour shifts and need a shoe that feels great all day. First these do run a little large and wide.  I usually wear a 7.5 with a medium width in Nike Running shoes but bought these in a 7.  The length is perfect but the shoe is a little wide so when I am walking my feet slide forward pushing my toes into the front of the shoes.  I am going to buy some insoles and see it that takes up the slack in the forefoot area. Otherwise the soles are so soft and I have no foot pain at the end of 12 hours, just sore toes."
"These sneakers are comfortable, my size is 7 1/2 and they fit me well, a little loose in width, BUT my biggest complaint is  a VERY STRONG CHEMICAL SMELL, it's an unbearable it makes me sick, I'm going to have to leave them in  forgetting and looking for others in what I find out how to take away that horrible smell."
"I just received these shoes and overall they're just ok.  You kind of have to expect to get what you pay for.  Unlike other reviewers, mine did not have a smell out of the package so that was a plus!  You can however tell they are SUPER cheaply made.  The mesh fabric on the back of one of my shoes is kind of sewn/stuck together funny and it creates a crease in the back of the shoe.  There is no tongue so when you pull she shoe strings, it creates a bubble on the front of the shoe.  I normally wear a 9.5 so that's what I bought and it does feel slightly large.  They are not the ""cutest"" sneakers.  The sole is a little bulkier than what I typically go for, but if you are wearing pants, it kind of covers the bulk.  I will probably not wear them with shorts this summer.I will say, these shoes are very comfortable and so far slip resistant.  I am a swimming official and am on my feet for 4-5 hours on a concrete and wet pool deck.  I have worn these 3 times so far and have not had any complaints about the comfort or slippage.  So for that, it is getting 4 stars rather than 3.If you need a cheap shoe and want to go for comfort over style.  These are a good buy.  They shipped quickly too."
Very nice fit good. Its comfortable and breathable inside i recommend add 1 size up if you want feel comfy in your feet. Soft inside because of the memory foam. Very light and easy to wear on and off. Nice unique color.
I bought these to wear to Jamaica on vacation. The colors resemble their flag and they are as vibrant as I was hoping! I get the most compliments with these shoes on and they are easy to pair with any outfit! I cannot wait to wear on vacation!
"I thought these were slip ons? They are not like what is pictured. They are shoes that tie.  Mine also came in a zip lock bag. Questionable if they were previously worn.  They fit larger. Typically I am a 10W.  Width was excellent, but fit more like a 10.5 and slipped off if that helps anyone with sizing."
I normally wear a 7 and 1/2 I had to return them because they were way too big I ordered seven they are still slightly big but they are comfortable because they are very lightweight but the backs always come crunched up so you have to really pull them and straighten them out but the souls are not rubber they are more of a plastic type rubber which is why they are lightweight but they don't slip so that is a good thing on the whole I would give them about a four out of five I like the color and my daughter is going to order the green pair as am I in the future and for the price they are pretty good
"Omg. They look good,but smell awful.  I can't get rid of the smell for 2 weeks already. I washed them in the laundry and nothing. Its plastic smell. Very very strong. And I read the comments. And nobody told that they have the smell,that's why I bought them."
"Ottimo il prodotto.Ho reso la taglia 41,5 e ho acquistato la taglia 41 che deve arrivare.Buono, veloce, chiaro il contatto con il venditore.SalutiClara Ravera"
Great buy
Delivered promptly. My granddaughter loved these. Sizing as expected.
Love them.
Feel apart very quickly
"They sent MENS.  I ordered women's size 7 and they sent men's size 7.  Not once but twice.  I ended up ordering something else.  The quality and look were very nice.  If you are looking for a casual dress shoe, very nice.  I just hope you get women's.  Worth the money ... if it works out for you.  It didn't for me."
Rockport is one of my favorite brands and this doesn't let me down.  Looks great and can be from semi formal to casual easily.  Wears with a pair of blue jeans or slacks no problem.  Feels great also.
"This shoe is made of good quality leather and feels like a sneaker.  If you're on your feet a lot this is the shoe to buy.  The shoe is true to size, so if you wear a 10.5 get a 10.5.  Remember they also offer wide width, I recommend going to a store and trying them on first or try Amazon wardrobe to get a better idea of how the shoe fits. Rockport also offers this shoe in brown.  This is my second pair and they last."
"First of all, the shoes are really great and light weight. The only issue I have is that I've had these for less than a week and worn them to work 5 times and the tread is already wearing down. I don't walk a ton at work, so this was a disappointing surprise, especially given the price point. I'll return these and continue the search for a decent work shoe."
"In New Balance running shoes, I'm an 11 EE. In Clark's, I'm a 10.  I assumed 10 Wide would be right in these too, but had to exchange for a 9 Wide. So they run extra large.Pros: lightweight, comfortable. Foamy midsole is comfortable for now.  Fairly classy looking with fresh jeans.Cons: lightweight (leather is pretty thin). Even in the Wide, the toebox is pointy and press my toes inward more than i would prefer.Decent kicks."
These are true to size and very erganomic with built in arch support. Most people just don't know their shoe size and are used to bad designs. The option for an E would be nice but Rockport only offers EE.
I don't wear any other brand except for Rockport because the comfort for my flat feet is excellent with these shoes. And I also got stopped a few times for compliments on my shoes.
My husband looks good in it. It’s not his first pair of shoes from this brand and he loves it. He says it’s comfortable and that’s why I keep going going back to it.
"I wear a 9.5 in almost every brand, including Rockport. Based on reviews I ordered a 9 and even this was too big.Toe longer/pointier than I expected or want, so I won't be exchanging.Laces oddly long.Shoe was very light and seemed well constructed."
"It's a quality shoe, but I've never purchased a shoe whose sizing is this far off. I'm a size 10 men's (usually wide width depending on manufacturer), but if I had to guess I would say this thing is a size 12 or 13."
"Ich war auf der Suche nach bequemem Kletterschuhen. Ich habe den Schuh in der gleichen Größe wie mein Straßenschuhe gekauft. Kletterschuh passt perfekt und ich kann den über viele Stunden tragen. Wer die Schuhe gerne etwas enger trägt sollte auf jedenfall 1-2 Größer kleiner als die Straßenschuhe wählen.1 Stern Abzug, weil auf den Zehen nicht viel Gummi ist. Daher nicht wirklich für ""Toe-hooks"" geeignet. Außerdem reibt man sich dann die Schnürsenkel über dem Zehenansatz auf.Bin aber dennoch super zufrieden, da endlich ein bequemer Kletterschuh, der ""normal"" ausfällt hinsichtlich Schuhgröße."
"Habe eher schmale Füße. Straßenschuhe 42 diese kletterschuhe in 41,5. Passen dann gut ohne den Fuß zu quetschen. Geht denke aber auch gut eine ganze Nummer kleiner. Sohle mit vorspannung. Haltbarkeit für mich gut. Einzig die Fersenbox ist relativ groß, wodurch das hooken nicht ideal funktioniert. Mein bisher liebster Schuh."
Schuhe und Farbe ist wie erwartet. Top
Amazing Shoe. I could use half size bigger but that is my fault. this shoe hold the rock or the wall well. i saw a significant improvement in my ability with this shoe.
"Seller (non-Amazon through Amazon) was great, arrived earlier than expected, product was exactly as described.  Style is awesome, SUPER cute, baby blue canvas with the tiniest bit of shimmer in fabric.  Foot cushion/sole/bed is decent.  Canvas foot upper is super STIFF!!  So stiff it can be felt across top of foot when bending foot to step.  These are super cute though, so I'm keeping them to try to break them in...though I'm pretty doubtful that the bend is going to get any more flexible. I don't know if a shoe stretcher would help - I don't have one.  I like them enough to not return and give them a try, but if I'd have tried them on in a store, I wouldn't have purchased them.  Possibly this was a manufacturing issue for the style, which is a shame because they look so good - unless they surprise me by really breaking in well, I won't be walking for long distances in these."
"After reading the reviews, I purchased the size 5 in this sneaker.  (I normally wear a 6).  When the shoes arrived, I was pleased that they were so cute, and that the length was perfect.  Unfortunately, the toe box was too narrow, and rubbed the side of big toe.  Too bad they aren't available in a wide width!  Back they go."
"I purchased my regular size, Women's sz.10 & they were too long by at least a half size, but the width was fine. I probably needed a 9.5. I returned them for a refund. I didn't replace them with a smaller size because I wasn't fond of the leather. In the pictures it appears to be a soft, supple leather, but I found them to be stiff & uncomfortable. Maybe they needed broke in? However, it's a very cute sneaker & considering that they're ""real leather"" at a good price, you may want to try them. I'd suggest ordering a half size smaller though."
I luv luv luv these fashion sneakers! They are beautiful and the fit is perfect! I got the floral print .
Perfect leather sneaker. Super comfy
These sneakers were not what I was expecting at all.  The material was very hard and not at all pliable.  I did not like the way they looked but I could have lived with that if material had been better.  Also I was expecting Aerosole type soles and these were not the same as my other Aerosole shoes
These sneaks are super cute and so soft! They are a little big but I’ll just put on a thicker sock 😊. The shoes are soft and the floral print pops! I’ll definitely enjoy wearing these! 🌼🌻🌸🌺
"This shoe is so cute.  The design runs large, it wide through the top of the foot and heel,  and it is stiff and does not aloe you to walk comfortably.  I did return the shoe"
"Now that I have the the time, I would like to say that the sneaker is not all that for the price of 87.00 bucks. The ones I bought before, the white ones were ten times better. And please, if the product doesn’t deserve a star, make it possible for submitting the information without having to give a simple star."
"These were comfortable to wear on a long plane ride and on a week long trip, right out of the box. They look good for an adult style without trying to mimic teen style.  Great with jeans, capris, and shorts."
Il bello di queste scarpe scamosciate è che se si dovessero sbiadire con la coloreria italiana si possono tinteggiare ora da un altro paio che avevo marroncino che si è sbiadito io ho portate a verde foresta e sono tornate come nuove quindi avendo preso un paio blu sempre della Geox respira mi sono trovato benissimo l'unica cosa che cambierei sono le solette quelle performance Marrone nere della Geox
Stivaletti di qualità. Molto comodi e leggeri.
"Conosciamo le scarpe Geox da anni. Gli stivaletti sono stati acquistati per mio marito che li apprezza molto, per qualità e comodità"
Compro sempre senza domandarmi nulla perché sono scarpe ben curate.
"Hola,producto recomendable,de buena calidad,cómodas y pronta llegada.Chao desde Manoteras."
Super tolle Schuhe die ich zum 3. mal gekauft habe. Sehr gemütlich und Top Preis Leistungsverhältnis

Stivaletto molto comodo anche da indossare . Calza un po' largo .
Leggerissime e comodissime

"belles et confortables, c'était celles que je cherchais et elles étaient presque épuisées mais je les ai enfin trouvées. La seule chose que j'aurais dû demander c'est un numéro de moins"
Super Schuhe.
Ich bin sehr zufrieden!

Very heavy for a running shoe
"Schnitt und Verarbeitung sind sehr gut, der Schuh ist auch bequem und ich hatte das erste Mal bei neuen Schuhen keine Blase vom Einlaufen. Einen Stern muss ich abziehen weil die Sohle etwas hart ist. Ansonsten ein toller Schuh."
"Super leichter Schuh, luftdurchlässig und angenehm zu tragen. Größe ist wie angegossen und auch die Lieferung war problemlos. Top!! Danke an alle ihr macht einen prima Job. Gern wieder!"
"Toller Schuh, man geht wie auf Wolken. Habe Probleme mit der Ferse, die ich in diesem Schuh fast gar nicht mehr spüre. Auf jeden Fall klare Kaufempfehlung!"
"schneller Lieferung, passt wie angegeben und sieht auch genau so aus wie auf dem Bild. Einfach klasse"
Estupendas zapatillas para largos paseos. Son muy ligeras y cómodas y tallan estupendamente.
"Die Schuhe sind sehr bequem und sehen gut aus. Ich habe es leider schon geschafft sie dreckig zu machen (Fleck von einer Beere o.Ä.). Der Fleck ging mit Fleckentferner ohne Probleme wieder raus ""trotz"" des strukturierten Stoffs. Top."
Also meine schuhe waren dreckig ! Was hat mich irritiert.
"Der Schuh so ist sehr schön und auch bequem,  aber leider ist der rechte Schuh breiter als der linke und so mit nur tragbar für den Hof."
La talla es correcta y el zapato queda muy bonito.
Meine Tochter ist mega zufrieden! Sehr gute Qualität! 👍
"My 11 year old daughter , who is usually picky at what she wears, loves these shoes. They look very pretty, are comfortable and seems to be well made. Time will tell :)Update :  As pretty as they are these sneakers turned out to be too narrow in the ball of the foot area (the widest part) and after a while start hurting.  For wearing them in a short period of time this is OK but when my daughter came back from the full day of school she complained and had marks on  the skin. Not her favorite shoes anymore."
We live in a small town where selection is limited.  We bought these and they are true to size and an excellent shoe for my daughter!
"A little smaller, but nice shoe"
Great Shoes.
Great shoes
Fit the Fit perfectly
Roza en el talón
"Son lindos, pero son demasiado grandes, si pedí mi talla pero igual están muy grandes"
"Cute and comfy, but they do run big"
"The shoes would be awesome if they weren't so huge. I got my regular size, but they're way too big. Tried them on and they were roomy, so I wanted to wear them to see how they'd work out, but I can't wear them because my feet slide around. Super disappointed, they're super cute."
LOVE THESE SHOES
"Ya que son tallas de usa vienen un poquito amplios, se ven de muy buena calidad y se miran muy bonitos, el material si es piel con algunas partes en sintetico, ayuda a que no se les cueza sus piecitos"
"Muy buen producto, solo tengan cuidado con la talla, yo calcule de acuerdo a la medida del pie de mi hija en CM, y le quedo como una talla mas grande."
simply perfect!
"Excelentes zapatos, muy duraderos"
"Talla y estado del articulo perfectos, totalmente satisfecha con el pedido solicitado, el envío muy bien, todo muy bien =)"
Estos tenis son de lo mejor para la escuela de los niños. El color y la calidad es el que se necesita para catalogarlo como un excelente producto
Buen material de manufactura. Ya antes he comprado este producto y tiene gran durabilidad.  Excelente calidad. Buena relación valor precio.
Hermosos
excelente calidad
Is this actually an authentic K-Swiss brand? Inside the tongue of the shoes show KAY-SWISS instead of K-Swiss. I may be wrong but I am not pleased with this. I have ordered two pairs of black for him to wear to school and I was pleased so I came back and ordered the white. While washing them I realized that this has Kay-Swiss written inside. I believe this is fake.
I don't like the look of tennis shoes so these are a nice alternative
Fits well and looks good.
Way to big
True to size. Bought it for 1999. Lower prices also available at times. Go for it anything less thn 2000. Perfect fit. Amazing color. Wear it ant ready to take the compliments.
"Die Optik ist aussergewöhnlich, bin froh, mir davon einen gesichert zu haben. Gefühlt schmaler Fuss, aber vermutlich nur subjektiv, da: neu!"
"Leider haben die Schuhe Klebereste. Zudem wird der Stoff total faltig nach paar Mal tragen. Dabei sind es nicht meine ersten Schuhe dieser Firma, bis dahin war immer alles okay."
"No se ajusta a la numeración, quedaba grande. Los gastos de devolución fueron 8€ , mucho dinero por algo que no vale"
"RAPIDA ENTREGA, PRODUCTO CORRECTO Y A UN  BUEN PRECIO"
Bei Schuhgröße 43 passt überhaupt nicht anstandslos zurück genommen so wie es sein soll
"Buen producto, bonito y de buena calidad. Yo lo tuve q devolver por el tamaño pero no me pusieron ninguna pega y me devolvieron el dinero sin problemas"
"Zapatillas muy cómodas y con un diseño perfecto, las recomiendo, envío sin ningún problema"
"Wie immer sehr bequem, bin zufrieden.  Alles perfekt"
Ottima qualità e calzata comoda
Very bad packaging received. Product is good but once I opened the amazon polythene box was all damaged and open from corners not sure if its been used before.
"Die Schuhe sehen wirklich schön aus. Wie bereits in den Rezensionen zu lesen, kommt man wirklich schwer in den Schuh rein (mit dem Schuhlöffel klappt es gut). Fie Öffnung der Schuhe ist so eng, sodass meine Füße arg abgeschnürt wurden. Ich habe keine dicken Füße, aber sie sind mir nach kürzester Zeit in den Schuhen eingeschlafen. Gehen leider wieder zurück."
"io ho sbagliato a prendere il mio numero classico, ma le scarpe sono spettacolari. Aderiscono perfettamente al pavimento, comode, leggere. naturalmente bisognerebbe prendere un numero in più (per questo non do 5), però hanno aderito molto bene al piede e si stanno allargando."
"La talla es correcta sin embargo el elástico del empeine es muy reducido, no estira y dificulta al meter el pie, no es pesado y el color es casi blanco."
"Devolvemos el producto porque era demasiado pequeño, y jamás recibimos nuestro reembolso. Estamos hace 3 meses reclamando la devolución del dinero y no hemos recibido respuestas. No recomendamos para nada este proveedor. Estamos muy disconformes. Exigimos una solución"
"Son de chica pero las he comprado, talla 42 perfectas siendo yo una talla 41"
"En algún comentario leí que estaban muy justos o que venían pequeños, creo que no me fue igual porque la medida es correcta"
"He tenido que pedir 2 veces y devolver las dos veces, me quedan súper pequeños. Una pena, porque me encantan y se ven comodísimos"
Muy cómodos y llegaron el día que indicaba
"Muy bonitos! Son delgados y se puede ver la calceta abajo del tenis, la talla viene justa, me hubiera quedado mejor media más grande"
Bonito diseño. Algo justo. Cuesta trabajo meter el pie. Material no flexible.
"Habe mir diesen Tennisschuh von Mizuno aufgrund des Preises und weil ich von dieser Marke Laufschuhe habe, bestellt. Ich habe die Schuhe in Größe 45 bestellt, meine „normale“ Größe ist ca. 44, also sollte man den Schuh 1 Größe größer bestellen, sodass er passt. Es ist ein sehr leichter Tennisschuh mit guter Passform und Dämpfung, zudem ist auch die Verarbeitung in Ordnung. Fazit: Guter Tennisschuh zu einem TOP Preis!"
Very good
"I have had these shoes for a few months now.  I mostly use them as a casual sneaker, but have done some limited running.  They are very comfortable and are holding up nicely.  I have not owned any Reebok shoes in recent years.  I usually wear a size 10 in Nike and Under Armour.  These Reebok shoes are a little larger.  Perhaps a 9.5 would fit, but the size 10 is not bad at all.Edit:  Downgraded to two stars.  Within six months, these shoes started falling apart.  I only wore them about 2 days per week.  Not durable."
"Un excelente producto, llego justo como esperaba y lo mas importante llevo un mes usandolos en el GYM y son muy comodos y gran calidad, super precio!!!"
"Use for work. I was hesitant due to the lack of insole, but after breaking them in they fit great. Plenty of room for my toes and very breathable. Nice enough for casual dress attire. Tried running, but stitching rubbed bottom of feet due to lack of insole."
Good shoes! And a good price!
"On the first day of wearing these my big toe joint was in pain, I could not wait to get home to get these off. The lacing system has a chunk of material embedded into the foam and that embedded piece dug in and caused no shortage of pain. Threw the pair away before the first week with them."
My wife got a pair of these and was so happy about the fit/support/style.She got me a matching pair and I agree with her.  For under $50 these are a smart sport style shoe.They feel and look good.  Construction is durable.
"Bought these for 2 of my sons for Christmas, after purchasing the women’s version for myself. They agreed with me that they are the most comfortable athletic shoes we’ve ever owned. Money well spent!"
I love to walk with this shoes
My husband loves the comfort he actually wants more colors so I will definitely shop again
Ok
Ended up in trash. Knock offs. Be warned.
Robusto y cómodo.
Ansich ein toller Schuh. Jedoch  ist er leider viel zu schmal obwohl ich bereits 1 Nummer größer gewählt habe und mein Sohn eine normale Fußbreite hat. Wenn er dann auch noch dickere Socken anzieht kommt er gar nicht mehr rein. Der Reißverschluss ist zudem schwergängig. Sehr schade! Geht leider zurück.
"Ein wunderbarer Wintersneaker von guter Qualität. Material und insbesondere der Reißverschluss an der Innenseite wirken hochwertig. Er fällt größengerecht aus, ist angenehm leicht und sieht zudem klasse aus. Wurde gleich vom ersten Tag an viele Stunden getragen und für sehr gut und warm befunden - für Übergang und leichten Winter ideal."
"Sehr schöner warmer Schuh für den Übergang (Herbst, wärmere Wintertage). Haben eine Nummer größer bestellt und diese passt perfekt. Durch den Reißverschluss lassen sich die Schuhe bequem an- und ausziehen. Leider geht der Reißverschluss ständig auf (trotz dem kleinen Klettverschluss, der oben am Reißverschluss angebracht ist). Sehr schade - sonst hätte es 5 Sterne gegeben."
"Der Schuh ist für unseren Jungen super trendy, hält warm, wasserabweisend und, sehr wichtig, atmungsaktiv sowie pflegeleicht"
Bought these shoes for my 10 year old daughter In a size 6 women and they fit as expected. She love’s them and says they are very comfortable.
"EXCELENTE CALIDAD, COMODIDAD Y TALLA ADECUADA. SIEMPRE PUMA A LA VANGUARDIA DE CALIDAD Y MODA. MUUUUYYYY VISIBLES. FANTÁSTICOS. A MI ESPOSA LE ENCANTARION."
Amazing shoeVery very comfortableAnd fashion A1
I’ve been looking for a good pair of shoes to work in. These look and feel like they might fill the bill but was so disappointed when I got them because they were to small so I have ordered another pair 1/2 size bigger and will see what happens when I get them.
I know how it feel to purchase shoes online and not getting the right size/ not the same as photo. I honestly can say that I LOVE these shoes!! They are a perfect fit and are so nice looking 😍These shoes are a YES girl.
Cómodos y muy buena calidad del producto además de el diseño muy bonito sin duda los volvería a comprar más adelante
Fit perfectly and very comfortable with the cloud foam.
"Run a bit smaller then stated,if u have to go half a size up other then that a very comfortable shoe"
They are a very comfortable fitting shoe
"These shoes are super cute, mine are a little tight because I got a 7 instead of 7.5, completely my fault. True to size"
Leggere e nello stesso tempo resistenti.
Scarpa ben fatta!
Size and fittings are much expected and very comfortable.Color is not so good.
Ordered a size 15 and it fit about two sizes too small. I ordered 4 pairs of shoes and tried the other 3 that fit perfectly. By the time I tried to put on this pair it was past the 30 day policy and I can't return. If anyone needs a size 15 let me know.
I like the shoe .  Just what I wanted.
Las tallas de Clark son más grandes he comprado 3 dientes tipo de calzado Clark y el 29.5 usa debe ser 27.5 MX y es 28 mx
Shoes are roughly 2 sizes larger than all my current Size US 10 shoes and i ordered 10.5 US. I can't give a proper review on the shoes themselves yet as i cannot wear them.
Wear these for hours. Made well and comfortable
Nice shoes!
"Made well and comfortable. Fit is true to size. Not water proof but seems to hold up to walking in dewy grass well. Very comfortable shoe , looks like a dress shoe but feels like a tennis shoe. Only negative for me was the laces. I Changed the shoe laces out for a dressier look.  Cant beat this shoe for the money!"
"These shoes look great, but they are way too long for the size. Made in India. I ran into the same problem in the past with Clarks made in India. They seem to have real QC issues at their factory. I usually wear 9.5 wide. I ordered 9.5W and 9W based on previous reviews. The 9W felt a size longer. I went back and ordered size 8.5W. These felt narrow and still were a bit longer than regular size 10. I added for comparison photos side by side of Clarks Navy Leather size 8.5W and Sperry Tan Leather size 10M."
"SIZINGFirst off, they're huge! I'm a 9.5/10 reliably. I got these in a 9, having read the many people who mistakenly bought their size only to discover these shoes are way way way oversized. Even at a 9, I was surprised at their footprint (no pun meant).When I sit them beside any other 9.5 footwear I own, these Clarks clearly tower past them. So look folks, buy 'em a half size down from what you normally wear.COMFORTStiff at first, but then, duh right? These are well-made shoes, so naturally they'll need time to open up and accommodate the nuanced geometry of your adorable feet. I've worn them now for about five hours at the office and they've already gone from, let's say, a 8 in stiffness to a 4. So, given a bit more time, they'll wear-in nicely. At first they also did made an audible ""pop"" sound, when folding at the toes as I open my stride. But again, when I say ""audible,"" I mean vaguely audible. I believe it's again related to their off-the-shelf rigidity. Once we beat on them a bit more, they'll surely become more malleable. Insole is soft and forgiving, without calling attention to itself as some kind of atom-splitting technology. I feel literally nothing invasive about these shoes. There is no ergonomics in design, for instance, that are stabbing my Achilles, or rubbing painfully against my well-moisturized, Irish-alabaster skin.APPEARANCELovely, unassuming, practical, wearable. Durable, well-built shoes, with rather understated style appointments. The stitching, for instance, around the sole is a nice rustic touch that appears durably manufactured. the bright(er) laces is a cool touch too, as it adds a nice contracting feature to their look. And the bone-colored sole is again a unsophisticated, but just declarative enough a treatment to call modest attention to them.FINAL VERDICTThey're Clarks, so there's that.  As Clarks go, these are a deal! Get 'em, gift 'em, wear 'em, paint the town in 'em (or the office)!"
"Der Schuh macht echt was her, die lose Sohle hab ich rausgenommen, weil sie für mich unbequem war, habe stattdessen Barfuß Sohlen genommen. Größe 41 passt perfekt. Die Verarbeitung ist top, Högl eben!!!!. Der Schuh ist  leicht vom Gewicht und sehr bequem zu tragen."
"Dieser Schuh ist echt ein Hammer, was Qualität und passender Sitz bedeutet.Und ich weiss wovon ich rede. Habe viele Probleme bei Schuhen, was Sitz betrifft.Aber hier, alles sehr gut. diese Marke ist bei mir gespeichert.Danke."
"Der Schuh ist sehr hochwertig verarbeitet, leicht und bequem. Innen und außen Leder, die Innensohle lässt sich herausnehmen für lose Einlagen. Leider quietscht meine Orthese beim Laufen sehr durch die Leder-Innenseite, so dass ich die Schuhe schweren Herzens zurückgebe. Für alle anderen: absolute Kaufempfehlung!"
"Too big. I ordinary wear size 38,5 Högl.  These I should have in 38."
"Der Titel sagt alles, Högl eben!"
Schnitt ist zu breit 😏
I ussually wear size 40 but this one are really big-
Great and confortable!
"I use this for gym. It’s almost like doing it with my socks. But they are shoes, hence the barefoot reference. I am quite happy with it z"
"These fit great. I am usually a size 7, sometimes 7.5 in athletic shoes. These have plenty of room. Easy to get on. I wore them around the house doing chores for two hours and they are very comfortable. I like that they are not the traditional water sock. They look just like athletic shoes but are very lightweight. 'Looking forward to wearing them on a beach this winter!Update:The main reason I wanted water socks /shoes is to minimize the sand getting between my toenails and cuticles.The first day I wore them during this, our beach trip, they were fine. Kept the sand out during the 2.5 mile walk along the beach. But the second day (similar to what James H. said), the seam in the inside middle of the right heel started to rub against my heel. By the third day, same thing on the left heel. There are seams on the inside heel. If they could be made without the seam in the middle of the heel, these would be great. When you are walking on sand, even compact sand closer to the water, the shoe will slip and then any seam will cause injury to the heel. I bought some gel heel insets, but they are curling and losing adhesion. It’s too bad because the shoes were doing what I wanted but also did something I didn’t expect."
"I super love these shoes are just what I wanted to wear outside while doing my yard work.  They are very light and waterproof.  The sole is just right too.  BUT I wear a 5.5 wide shoe , I bought size 6 and I struggled and struggled to get them on.  I only wore them less then 5 minutes and my feet were getting numb.  So you might wanna go with 2 sizes bigger.  If only they had half sizes.  Also if the shoes had a tongue on them it would be much easier to get on.  I guess I have fat feet. I gave these shoes a 5 star rating because they are great if you have skinny feet."
The STQ water shoes are both functional and cute. Just looking at them you would never know they are water shoes instead of a regular tennis shoes. I normally wear a 9.5 and I ordered the 9-10 and they fit snuggly. They’re super comfortable and very supportive! I purchased these to wear on the Wisconsin River kayaking. We take a very marshy route to the river and I have problems walking through the mud and reeds. Super easy to clean. I’m not sure if I’d throw them in the washer but I’d definitely take a hose to them. Did I mention they’re super cute?
"I bought the size 9-9.5. I usually wear a 10-10.5 in nike and other shoes. I used these for my trip to Destin, Fl. That were perfect. I ran on the beach, I walked, I wore them everywhere. I have since used them at the lake. They are so comfortable I even wore them to the gym. I have high arches and a narrow foot and they fit like a glove. I wish I could find a distance running shoe as comfortable but with long term support. They washed out easy by hose and dryed out super fast."
They fit very well. I use them mainly in the pool. I bought them because I do water aerobics and I didn't want to rough up the soles of my feet. They dry over quickly.
"I teach water aerobics 4 days per week. I have been wearing these shoes for almost a month and I am very pleased thus far. They are incredibly lightweight. The insoles are easy to remove for drying. I appreciate that the laces are not stretchy, which allows me to tie a tight double bow.  They have come untied during class a couple of times, but the band around the top of the shoe is snug enough that I do not have to stop to retie. I have worn a lot of different styles of shoes through the years and these might be the best so far."
"These feel wonderful when in the water and don't flop around. They are lightweight. However, they do seem a little small for the size. I wanted to be able to adjust the tightness and saw these had laces. They are very tight to put on and I feel they will rip or wear quickly to have to ""force"" my foot in. The laces are more decorative than anything, there is no adjustable opening.  If you have a high instep these will not work for you. I don't and they are a chore to put on. But again once they are on they feel nice."
"Wore these during a 2 hour gold panning adventure with the kids.  We were in the river, walking around on top of river rocks the whole time and these performed beautifully.  Protected my feet from the rocks and debris,  drained well and were so comfortable that I didn't really give a thought about what was on my feet the whole time. After air drying, they still look good.  I wear a size 8 Medium to Wide shoe (fit into M, but will pick the W when available) and the 8-8.5 worked for me."
"Honestly the best water shoes I have ever purchased. They look nice, super comfortable and super light! I purchased them to wear them to a water park and I was able to go in the pools with them and then walk around the park right after without having to take them off or worry about letting them dry! They are super comfortable, feel like actual sneakers and great for hot weather because of the little wholes they have all over! Love them! If they came in different colors I’d buy another pair!"
"They are kind of like the cheap ""made in china"" shoes you would find at the dollar store. You know, made for people with square feet, no support and they only feel good if tied very tight. I can't imagine these are actually ""adidas"" shoes."
"Sneaker came in perfect condition, absolutely new. Shipping was within 2 days via Amazon Prime.Sneaker fits true to size. I would recommend buying the same size as your Stan Smiths/ Jordan 1 size."
"Great looking shoes though I haven't gone anywhere yet -saving them for when we get liberated from the Covid 19 lockdowns and mask wearing. Gives one something to look forward to-like we used to say back in the day - I'll look ""fly"""
"My son wears a size 1 currently in both his pairs of adidas shoes. So we ordered a size 2 in these. They are barely any bigger then the size 1s... im talking like maybe half a cm bigger. Really nice shoes, look great but just too small in sizing."
"Fake Adidas, glue on the sides, box was all crushed. If it was real Adidas, they would provide an extra pair of laces. They are REALLY cheap. Good looking, but CHEAP and FAKE."
My son loves these shoes I did buy no tie laces for them but they are easy for him to get one and off.
Bon produit
Good quality shoe my son loves it
"Sehr schön, aber nicht besonders bequem."
"They are the perfect ""dress"" runner for my son."
"Nice, but size 6.5 seems to be 7 if not 7.5. too big for me, hence returned.Packing was not good. Sent in soft brown paper bag.There was no return label included in the box. Should not happen. Not all customers have printers at home."
Esta demasiado grande soy 4.5 medio y me quedo enorme y ancho como si fuera 5.5ojala alguien mi hubiera escrito q vienen amplios
Very happy with my purchase.My shoes fit well.My shoes look like the picture.Delivery was fast
Me encanto los colores y materiales son hermosos
Me encantan
"It gives me a little more wiggle room in the toe area, which is a very nice change of pace for me! I wear 11 in Women, and I often find that shoes can be a little narrow for me in the toe area. The elderberry is a pretty cross-shade of mauve, rose, and light purple. The suede and leather textures look really nice together, and the thick, white sole with the strip of lavender gives me a nostalgic look and feel that I enjoy a lot! They're so comfortable and super cute. I highly recommend them!"
"Very cute, sporty, stylish shoes that my daughter loves. Great quality, accurate fit. She says they are very comfortable to wear and she gets lots of compliments at school. Compare favorably to more expensive brands. Would buy again from Puma"
I just didn't like the style of the sneaker on my feet. It felt ok on my feet. It looked too manly on me.
Soooooooo cute these colors pop
The shoes were a true to size fit. I got elderberry and loved the color! It’s perfect sneaker to wear for a day to day look. Not quite workout shoes material but definitely good if you’re doing a lot of walking or on your feet all day.
Fits true to size! Very cute.
I tried a few other types of slides and sandals but returned them all. I’ll definitely keep these. Comfortable and look good.
"Scarpette meravigliose ad un ottimo rapporto qualità-prezzo! Dal vivo sono ancora più belle! Attenzione con la scelta del numero perché calzano un po' grandi, io ho preso per mia figlia il numero abituale e va' grande, ma essendo leggere, conto di indossarle più avanti. Spedizione rapida, arrivata diversi giorni prima del previsto. Unica nota negativa se si volesse fare un regalo, come potete vedere dalle foto, le scarpe sono arrivate con l'etichetta originale ma in una scatola sostitutiva neutra perché quella originale è stata danneggiata durante il trasporto, peccato! Per il resto ottimo acquisto, lo consiglio."
Molto belle ma vestono larghe
Sono davvero molto belle.
La horma es muy grande. Aconsejaría comprar un número menos. Muy lindos y fuertes.
Très bon produit mais taille petit
Useless after 1 month of light useSevere knee painInto garbage
Need to make better design and the shape of the feet is not flat from the toes up it gets high !!!shoes is too flat out need height !
"Excellent, very good materials, the size is appropriate and they are very beautiful"
"La talla perfecta, el material excelente, si cumple con todas las expectativas súper que recomendado"
I love sneakers and I play mostly outdoor these were an amazing value for the price
my husband loves his sneakers they fit perfectly
El calzado me quedo muy buen a la medida excelente
Great design but uncomfortable.
Great fit and look.
"Se ajustan a la descripción, tienen buena tracción buen agarre al suelo para practicar el baloncesto"
"Habe die Schuhe bekommen, angezogen und bin losgelaufen. Sie sind leicht und bequem und von sehr guter Qualität. Kann sie nur weiterempfehlen, sind jetzt meine Lieblingsschuhe !"
"First let me start by saying I ordered these back 3 months ago and waited to review to test durability. My boys go through shoes like crazy, typically every 2/3 months their shoes are ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED and in need of new ones. I've tried several different top brand shoes (nike, adidas, underarmor, stride rite, ect.) And NONE of them held up to my kids except these. My kids play HARD and these shoes hardly even have scratches on them after 3 months! I'll be purchasing again hands down because as far as quality and durability this is by far the best you can buy for your kiddos! Hope this review is helpful for other parents with destructive kids!"
"These run a half size smaller than other Sketchers styles and much narrower. The quality seems to be fine, but they don't fit my child at all and I will be returning them."
"Great Sketchers, our child loves them!"
Exactly what my son wanted - red with memory foam.
Very curable shoe. Fits as expected. Son loves this shoe.
Mi hijo los ama
Good quality..
Muy bonitas y comodas aunque la suela no agarra bien
"Good looking shoe but I'm sorry to say the shoe runs ""very narrow"".Women's 6.5 size is very close to expected length.For the price it is a good shoe although I wish the width was more in line with what a ""US"" size medium actually is.I have purchased several different athletic shoes through AMAZON and to tell the truth they have all been on the narrow side (even to the extremely narrow) and I wish AMAZON would finally step up and do something about it. If you read almost any shoe review most if not all complain about the shoe being too narrow. How about stepping up AMAZON???"
"My boy tried it for his first soccer tournament and he was thrilled!They look very good and he said it was much better than regular sport shoes.I confirm he moves a little differently as it seems to have more grip.If you found it helpful, thanks for clicking  ""Helpful"" ;)"
"For the price, can't go wrong and they're the top brand for soccer shoes! My daughter loves them for soccer practice and she says they're comfortable. I'm pretty sure I saw these in store today for 3x the price"
As described and very fast delivery
"After months of wearing, no complaint from the kid yet!"
what a let down.  nice looking shoes but they started to fall apart within 2 months.  the soles at the toe started to come unglued.  You would think adidas would have better construction for soccer shoes.
"Great shoe, very comfortable and light weight - my son plays indoor and he loves these shoes"
Grandson loves these for indoor soccer on a basketball court! He said very stylish
My 8 year old loves it for indoor soccer. It looks nice and sleek. He loves how he doesn’t slide on gym floors.
My son has used these before and has always loved them.
My son plays futsal several times a week and is very picky about what shoes he wears. He loves these shoes and has from the start. They fit him well and he doesn't get blisters.
"Ein fantastischer Schuh, optisch wie auf den Fotos, wirkt sehr hochwertig und am Fuß so ziemlich das Beste, was ich je getragen habe. Da ich die Schuhe täglich von morgens bis abends trage, drinnen wie draußen, kann ich nur sagen: man spürt ihn kaum. Ich habe mir tatsächlich 3 Paar nachbestellt, habe jetzt also insgesamt 4 Paar bestellt, 2 x Cognac,  2 x Dunkelbraun. Den Preis von 67 € konnte ich mir nicht entgehen lassen, und den Schuh werde ich noch lange lieben."
"Dachte, erst mal bestellen und dann schauen wir mal.. Aber ich war beeindruckt; sehr bequem, super Qualität, tolle Passform, ideal mit Jeans.. Die behalte ich auf jeden Fall."
Botas de piel de mucha calidad y muy cómodas de llevar la talla corresponde a la que uno usa
"Gefällt mir sehr, sieht sehr schön aus und sind wirklich bequem ☺️"
Ein absolut schöner und bequemer Schuh!!!
Passt wie gewohnt
My husband has a neurological disease which makes it very hard for him to bend down and put on shoes and socks. The Velcro tab on a zipper at the top opens the shoe wide so he can easily slide his foot in.  And they zip up tight enough that his foot doesn't slide when he walks (with a walker). He says they're also comfortable. We were very pleased with this purchase.  I'm thinking of stocking up in case they become discontinued.
"Got these shoes and my son loved them.  Only problem is, is that the zipper broke on one of them.  Now he can’t wear them and I’m tore on what to do."
"Trabajo como funcionario de seguridad pública, y paso al rededor de 24 hrs con las botas puestas y hasta ahora me resultan muy cómodas y ligeras. A parte de que se ven elegantes, la comodidad qué ofrecen es una maravilla."
"Being using them everyday for a year now, still look like new, one of the best boots I've ever used."
"At first, I put these on at home and stood up on the carpet in them. Ahhh... soft, memory foam. Light weight. Flexible. The side zipper is tight. The laces are thick. The leather feels like quality. Should be good right? Not so much. I'm 14 days in and I'm writing this with sore feet. Instead of writing you a story, I'm just going to list the problems with these boots...1) Memory foam is too thin, results in zero cushioning on hard surface while making your feet sweat profusely.2) No arch support. The inside is flatter than dollar store dress shoes.3) No side to side support. This means your heel will move, and since they are light and flexible, you'll likely roll your ankle.-All this can be solved with buying a nice insert from Sof Sol, like I did... except there is still one more COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE problem.4) Small cracks in the sole. Yes, water can leak up through the bottom of this boot between the tread resulting in wet feet (I hope that was water...) At least I didn't slip in it.There is one really big positive these though... The top of the boot, where it meets your shin and calf is really nice. There is nothing sharp or rough edged to make that uncomfortable in the slightest. I've tried a lot of boots over my years of military, contractor, and corrections... and the top half of these boots are best in the business. Too bad the bottom half is the most important.Thankfully Amazon has a great return policy and wonderful customer service!"
"I was hesitant about getting these for work to replace my Bates that I really liked.After 3 months they are holding up great. Breathable, strong leather & they feel similar to my running shoes, with the added protection of a boot. I'm on my feet all day and I have no issues or pains at the end of shift while wearing these  If they make it to next year I will be buying another pair"
"Very stiff boot. I'm surprised how long it's taking to break it in. I purchased the Oakley SI boot and it fit like a sneaker, so I expected the same from reebok. I don't waste my time and money with Nikes garbage, so I went to reebok, but so far I'm not impressed. Additionally, the top of the boot is to wide for my chicken legs. I have to strap it down with my laces. One positive is the sole. It has great grip and good cushioning. The inner soles are also very comfortable."
"Really good boots. These fit well and are comfortable and light. A very good value for the price. I didn't need to break them in, though they do seem to be more comfortable than they were initially. I find them a little difficult to put on. My foot seems to not like getting into them initially.They are supposed to weigh less than the Danner Tachyons but they feel heavier on the foot."
I've been wearing them daily for about a month.  I'm an engineer inside construction sites and needed a boot that's comfortable to wear for 10-12 hours.  I chose the non-waterproof boots as they're typically cooler and breath better.  You can pick the waterproof version if you'll be out in it more often.  Typical very good quality of Reebok.  I would absolutely buy these again.
There is no arch support in this boot which makes it very uncomfortable wearing them all day. I work ten hour shifts and my feet hurt really bad by the end of the shift. I have also had these boots for barely over a month and the toe seams have already began to pull out and the toe is pulling loose. I work in law enforcement which is what they advertise these boots for wear. I do not recommend these boots as duty boots.
Horrible. Not even a year old and they are coming apart at the seams. The sole is peeling away from the shoe.Not happy
"Very comfortable walking, moving around and sitting but not as much when just standing at the same place for a long period"
"Gute, wertige Schuhe ohne modischen Schnickschnack. Dicht, auch von unten und ausreichend warm. Bis jetzt, nach gerade einer Woche, hochzufrieden. Größe fällt neutral aus."
"Como recomendacion cuando los laven, no lo hagan con cepillo por que es tela brillosa y se quita lo brilloso."
Wore these to a concert and they were comfortable and stylish. Will buy from company again
"I purchased this sneakers about 3 months ago for my child, quality is poor. Her first Puma sneakers and i guess it will be her last one."
Perfectas muy lindas
they run a half size small. thank goodness i bought them big for my daughter. she loves them. they are adorable and bright!
comfortable will buy again
Es muy cómodo y súper cute
Son preciosos
Love the colors and really nice
The shoes fit my daughter great and they look nice!!
Il prodotto era apposto però c'era scritto spedizione gratuita e i vece alla fine me l'anno messa 4 euro e non è giusto almeno saperlo prima che aggiungevano 4 eueo
Prodotto ottimo.
"Dieser Schuh ist top - sehr bequem und gut zu tragen - fast wie ein Hausschuh. Da er auch etwas größer ausfällt, kann man auch noch Einlegesohlen reinlegen oder es reicht dann noch der Platz, wenn man dickere Socken anziehen möchte. Kann den Schuh 100%ig weiterempfehlen. Mit der Lieferung ging auch alles sehr schnell und unkompliziert."
Super leicht angenehm zu tragen. Habe sonst immer Problem mit den Größen aber bestellt und passt. Lieferung war sehr schnell. Bin froh Prime Mitglied zu sein.
"Diseño inigualable para un clásico y deportivo zapato náutico.  Para usar con bermudas, jeans y pantalon tipo dockers.  En color azul navy y blanco que combina con cadi todo en una indumentaria sport casual."
"The traditional Sperry , the sailing shoe that put them on the map."
I love me some Sperry’s.  I’m a size 10 in running shoes and also a 10 in Sperry’s - fits perfectly!!
Great shoe. Fits like a glove and they're very ligjt weight and comfortable to wear.
A++++
Perfect!
Sperry always offers top quality footwear..these are no exception.
It feels as though you are walking directly on the floor.Recommend using some gel insoles with these shoes.
Best shoes I have ever had
5 star
Per ora tutto ok
As expected
"I am an old swamp yankee, almost 70, and have worn AD Boost for many years just for the comfort because of these old arthritic knees. Now it is hard to find a bargain in the lighter shades for guys so I looked up womens and found a pair for 50 bucks. Two sizes larger is the usual for womens for guy, but went 2.5 larger and they are just right. Lots of room in the front in this model. I can not imagine anything being more comfortable.  I first bought a pair many years ago after one of the runners magazines rated it the highest for shock absorption. The boost material was developed by Mercedes Benz for the dashboards of their autos. Give them a try!"
I had a 7 1/2 but ended up ordering an 8 because the toe tends to taper downward and I needed a little more toe space.  I love this shoe for walking.  My grandson is a shoe fanatic and he recommended any boost by Adidas and he did not steer me wrong!!
"I ordered a size 8 and they were too small. Upped to a size 9 and they are perfect with a little big of wiggle room! I bought these specifically for a vacation where I’d be walking up to 20,000 steps a day and they have NOT let me down. Every other tennis shoe I’ve tried make my heels and arches hurt after a few hours. I’m on day four in a row of wearing these, walking miles a day and my feet don’t hurt one bit. So comfortable and I love the style! Would 100000% recommend!!"
I absolutely love this shoes. They are so comfortable. I use them just for running and they give me stability during my run. Great shoes.
These felt very bouncy and would've been awesomely comfortable if they hadn't ran small un my opinion. Just too snug. I would say order 1/2 to 1 size up especially if wearing socks
The back of the shoe hurt my heels. I expected these to be better quality. Disappointed.
I was a little worried these might be fake but they came in the original adidas box & look exactly like the other Senseboots I have. Fit and look great.
"Premetto che ho acquistato il modello in Gore-tex. Di per se una scarpa pesante che pesa oltre i 450g (per piede). La uso in particolari allenamenti e su neve e fa davvero il suo lavoro. Protegge il piede come nessun altra scarpa da trail. Unica pecca, avendo un drop 12mm la sconsiglio in trail con discese molto lunghe. Essendo pure abbastanza rigida i vostri tendini di Achille vi malediranno. Consiglio il modello non in Gore-Tex che ha un drop di 9mm"
"Pratico trekking molto di frequente e sono costretto a cambiare scarpe con altrettanta frequenza. I modelli de La Sportiva sono i migliori in termini di comodità ed affidabilità. Questo modello offre grip elevato, morbidezza, comfort ed assoluta impermeabilità. Cosa desiderare di +?"
Super scarpa!! Consiglio un numero o un numero e mezzo in più!! Ottima tenuta su qualsiasi superficie
"la scarpa è molto comoda e costruita con materiali superlativi, vale pienamente il prezzo"
"llego 7 dias antes, cumple todas las expectativas"
È perfetta
"Muy buenas y cómodas, llegaron pronto y cumplían mis expectativas . las he probado por monte con lluvia y son geniales"
"Scarpa di ottimo livello, come ci si può aspettare da La Sportiva. Semi impermeabile, leggermente rialzata per le pozzanghere, e con un'aderenza fantastica in ogni condizione. Molto più leggera e pratica di uno scarponcino, è ideale per escursioni montane. Molto ben ammortizzata in ogni punto.È una scarpa invernale quindi molto calda, anche sul bagnato. Leggera da usare come scarpa da montagna, ma troppo pesante per la corsa su strada.Attenzione: calza stretta di 1 numero, quindi se avete il 44 di piede, prendete in 45. Nell'indecisione, abbondate."
Veste normale qualità media per il prezzo pagato va bene
Me encantan y comodas
Elles sont jolies mais beaucoup trop étroites ! Mon fils a pourtant les pieds fins et impossible de fermer l'avant sans lui écraser les orteils ! Dommage.
"Sehr bequeme weiche Schuhe, die reiben oder rutschen nicht. Mein Sohn liebt es."
Würde ich nicht noch mal kaufen nach zwei Wochen sind die Sandalen kaputt gegangen .
Une des attaches des scratch arrière  s'est décousue au bout de quelques heures....qualité scandaleuse pour des kappa. J'ai demandé le remboursement.
🖒
Super Schuhe
"Top Schuhe,ob zu Wasser oder Wandern.Halten sehr gut und nächstes Jahr bestimmt auch noch."
Leider auch das zweite paar innerhalb kürzester Zeit  defekt.
"Son excelente, aunque mas grande de lo que normalmente usa, aun asi no se los quita, son expectaculares y por el precio simplemente magnificos"
"Mi hija quedó a gusto con el diseño y la comodidad del producto, es una marca que no habíamos utilizado y queríamos conocerla."
"My son wore his Pumas for 1 week before the front of both sneakers came apart from the shoe. I notified the seller and Amazon with regard to the issue. A return was approved, however I later found out that I’d have to pay to ship the shoes back, despite the fact that I purchased these on prime. It will cost me almost as much to send them back as it would to keep not. I’m disappointed in this seller and in Puma in general."
"I got these shoes for my 9 year old, as a black on black shoe for a dance recital.  They are great shoes but the price is just ridiculous.  I like buying quality shoes for kids but it is just illogical, that I could buy a men's 10.5 for me for $50 and then a kids size 2.5 for $50.  Literally one of my shoes is two of the smaller ones.  I get that they are the same shoe and quality but a smaller kids shoe, which is less material should be less.... sorry for my rant. With all that said though they are great shoes for a kids and the quality far exceeds that of the cheaper off name ones you find."
We bought these for our daughter as part of her Christmas gifts so she hasn't worn them yet. I opened them and they seem to be well made. The leather is soft and soles have a lot of grip. We chose these for those reasons. Her under armour shoes were stained within 2 weeks and it was impossible to get it completely out of the cloth. Hopefully these hold up for a very active 7 year old.
"I opted for these because of the look and build.  I'm a size 8 in Womens (a size 6.5 in Big Kids).  They're BEAUTIFUL and have been pretty sturdy thus far (I received them on Wednesday).  My one complaint is how tight the shoe was on the top of my foot.  I attempted to loosen the laces to see if that would help, but it wasn't the problem.  The foam insert wasn't allowing my foot to fit correctly, causing it to be much too snug and creating pain.  Once I removed the insert, it was fine and still very comfortable.  **Note: I've never had a problem wearing Big Kids shoes since I'm overall tiny in stature.**  Nonetheless, I don't regret the buy!"
So my son has only worn the shoes a few times because he always complained fron fay one that they were tight well after begging him to put his shoes on i tried to get them in and the obviously do not fit but i knew it wasnt possible because they are supposed to be a size 11 well out of curiosity i check the tag inside and guess what they are not a size 11 like i ordered they are a size 10 apparently i recieved the wring size and never knew it😡 but other than being sent the wrong size which makes them a useless pair of shoes and a waste of almost $40 they are very cute and nicely made...
"The shoes look nice but they run small in that they are very narrow. My son has a pretty avg size foot, not wide or anything. They hurt his feet when he tried to get them on. He wears a 5.5, but we are returning them. We can’t go up a size to a 6 because it would be too long for him. It’s a shame, they really are nice."
"Molto belli, di qualità"
"The back of the shoe where your heel slides into the shoe wore out within 3 weeks of purchase.  I love my pumas,  but I dont think they take the same care in kids shoes as they do adults..... or at least it seems that way.  Anyway,  very unhappy with this item."
Belli e comodi. Calzata perfetta.  Strafelice.
"My daughter had the exact same shoe in pink but it was getting tight and she loved it. So we got the next size up in teal. SHE LOVES IT!!! It fits through to size and is very comfortable. She wears it all day, even when at home!"
"Les chaussures plaisent beaucoup à ma fille et je pensais avoir acheté des chaussures de qualité qui feraient tout l'été...mais au bout de deux semaines les chaussures semblaient avoir plusieurs mois d'usure avec une décoloration du cuir, les languettes qui rebiquent et la semelle sous le talon déformée. Je regrette cet achat."
Parfait8
Ottima la qualità
"Very comfortable walking shoe but also stylish!Initially I ordered my regular size, when they came they were too big. I ordered the next size down, they are perfect! Would suggest ordering a 1/2 size smaller.With Prime, the return/exchange process could not have been easier."
"My 8 year old son is just now getting into a size 2, so that's what I ordered and I will agree with other reviewers that these run big. If they were for me, I'd return them but kids grow right? Anyway, the length is the same as his other size 2 shoes but they're very wide, especially in the toe box. They are adjustable with the bungee cord, but there is not an adjustable back strap as another reviewer claimed. The picture is accurate, no adjustable back strap! He says they're very comfortable, and loves the way they look. Wore them to school all day right away and no blisters/ breaking in period. Just as nice as my other child's keens."
"The top stretch cinch frayed and broke within 3 weeks of wear.  My grandson loved the style.  Although the shoe was generously sized, the cinch was not stretched tight."

"Il prodotto è come in foto. Ottima qualità come del resto si sa della Timberland. Sono calde e ben impermeabilizzate, e noi le abbiamo usate sulla neve, e nonostante tutto il calzino non si è bagnato. Ancora i colore non si è rovinato nonostante siano state maltrattate non c'è male"
Le Timberland sono sempre garanzia di qualità!! Scarpe bellissime comprate per mio figlio che consiglio senza dubbio alcuno. Prodotto fedele alle descrizione del venditore... calzano leggermente strette
ottimo scarponcino in pelle ben costruito poi conoscendo la scelta dei materiali Timberland credo che non ci saranno problemi
"Ho comprato queste paia di scarpe invernali in sconto a circa 40€ e mi sono piaciute, il camoscio al tatto è buono, con pelle morbida e vellutata al tatto , il colore è il solito di Timberland. Per questo prezzo, se lo trovate, ve lo consiglio"
"l'unico problema è la taglia, che calza poco. Non c'era il numero più grande e dovuto fare reso"
"Ansich ein schönes und wertiges Produkt. Die Schuhe waren aber nicht neu sondern wurden bereits getragen, gebraucht mit Sand und Erde zugestellt."
Molto comodi ed eleganti! Misura perfetta... Consigliati!
"Bonjour,Achetée pour la rentré en maternelle de mon fils de 3 ans.Elles sont très très belle, douce, fine ne font pas de gros pieds.Je recommande les yeux fermés."
Arrivate prima del previsto. Apparentemente di buona fattura.. peccato che siano arrivate con la targhetta del logo staccata su una scarpa....
Leider nicht richtig vernäht von innen und drückt an den Füßen richtig rein. Schade.
"I bought these sandals primarily for wearing at beaches and on boat excursions while on cruises, after a similar pair wore out and had to be discarded.  The cushioned sole is very comfortable.  While I haven't yet worn them for my intended purpose, they appear to be sturdy enough to protect my feet on coral or rocky beaches, and the tread should provide good traction for slippery surfaces.  They slip on easily, and it's easy to adjust the laces for comfort.  I don't need to wait for a cruise to wear them!"
This is WAY TOO BIG.  The tag size says 6.5 but i ordered a size 7.  The fit was a good 1.5-2 inches longer than my foot.  Obviously the sizes are not correct.They look like good quality and look to be comfortable.
"Love that they are very comfortable, and wear them around my gardening so I don't have to get my sneakers wet.  Easy to slide on and off, they dry quickly.They don't have an especially thick sole, so I don't wear them for hiking.  I did notice that because they are somewhat enclosed, there is a tendency for sand to become trapped inside the shoe.But overall, a really nice water shoe!"
"I am grossed out. I ordered these and inside is someones old, dirty inserts. They need to have better standards here for the price. I have only just received and reluctantly put them on (still grossed out btw) and they are comfortable and I hope a good fit for hiking multiple terrians. Looks like someone already tried that though...wish they would of left me a comment card along with their gross dirty inserts."
I wear a 7 in heels and 7.5 in tennis shoes so I got a 7.5 and they fit perfectly. I got them for a camping/hiking trip and I have zero complaints. One thing I thought was funny was how I was sitting by the fire and a bee or two came to check them out because of the bright peach I suppose. Highly impressed with the low price I paid for these and would HIGHLY suggest the purchase!
I've only worn them for two days they feel pretty good have a bit of an arch which others didn't. I ordered an 81/2 they came in an 8 and still feel too big. My foot does measure an 81/2. But I feel if I got a 7 they be too small
These run at least a half size to big. I wear a 9 and ordered these in 81/2. If I ordered an 8 they would fit but getting the strap on would be too tight. My foot is wide very happy with the 8 1/2. They are light. Lighter than keens that were very nice but wear too big and heavy. The keens would not stay on my feet.
"Wore these shoes to walk around Disney for a week. Comfy, dries quickly & lightweight."
"I would definitely say to get about a half size smaller than you'd normally wear, but other than that they're great, especially for the price. I went hiking through water and mud and they held up strong with minimal slippage. I hosed them down after and they looked good as new and dried quick enough for me to wear to work the next day."
"Got these shoes for River and splash pad play.  Very comfortable, true to size"
"Me encantaron, el color super vivo tal cual la imagen de un lado gamuza y el otro tipo charolMuy comodos y llegaron super rapidoDefinitivamente los recomiendo"
"Me encantaron!! Justo como los esperaba, el diseño está fuera de lo común, por lo que llamaron mi atención desde un principio... son mi color favorito!!"
"Están tal cual en la imagen, llegaron rápido y sin mayor complicación, se ven de calidad."
Not at all the same as the picture in color. Buyer beware
"After reading reviews I decide to order a size up and they are HUGE. These shoes are true to size and I even have wide feet, but they are well made and sooo cute!"
"These looked awful on, unless you ""bowling shoes"" is the look you are going for then perhaps if worn ironically they might be okay. But I was not and did not realize from the description that one half of each shoe was matte (sort of suede-y) , which I expected, and the other side was shiny, which I did not. Also, tongue comes up kind of high, which is not exactly comfortable. But returning them mostly because they are UGLY!"
Too Me Their Ugly I Wear Them Too Work only.
These are really cute and fit well. I wear them to work and for casual outfits.  I'm going to purchase more colors.
I love my shoes I will be purchasing the blue one next thanks
Perfect fit for my daughter. She says they are very comfortable.. Throw them in the wash and they look good as new. Unfortunately the sole liners came out pretty easily with the wash so I had to buy new ones.
This is the second pair I’ve bought of this style and I think I like these more than my black and red ones
"They fit perfectly and are very comfortable, according to my daughter. Gets dirty very easily, obviously being white, but are easy to wash and dry quickly. Very lightweight, and slip on easy and don’t fall off when walking."
"I got them for my 9 year old, they are nice but thin and have little to no arch support, great spring time shoe, not for cold or wet weather."
Perfect PE shoes for my daughter. Teachers don’t have to help with tying!
I bought these for my autistic daughter.  She loves them because she can independently put them on and take them off.  She loves the colors and the comfort 💕 . I highly recommend this product. It's the third pair I've purchased over the past 3 years. They hold up great for my daughter that us super active.
Love ADIDAS. ALL HANDS DIWN.  BUT..  I couldn't put my foot into EVEN THE OPENING OF shoe.  So sad.. Pretty shoes
"My daughter loves these shoes - we have bought them in every color offered. They are the most comfortable- true to size, perfect fit shoe and do not slide up in the back as she runs!"
"I like the fact that the shoes are comfortable and true to size, yet they are so easily stained and hard to clean."
Size is accurate. Great quality. Easy for son to slip on.
"Están super las botas. se ven algo bromosas y pesadas pero cuando te las pones no se nota, la calidad es la esperada.Sólo tengan cuidad con la talla, vienen muy amplias. voy a solicitar devolución pero sin duda las recompro medio numero menos para que calcen al 100%.La suela está genial, sin duda botas para el trabajo y mejor para salir a caminar por el campo. son todo terreno."
"En Talla estuvo bien, calidad de los materiales excelente, lo único es que si están algo pesadas esperaba algo ligero. De ahí en fuera todo bien"
Son exelentes solo un poquito grande
Great shoes at great price. People commented on toe problems. I was kinda worried about that. But I had no problems. I ordered size 12 and usually wear 12-12.5. Fit fine for me. But may recommend 1/2 size down. I also have narrow feet which may be why no toes issues. Would recommend highly. I can tell ill be wearing these awhile. High quality. Ill update otherwise.
Seemed solid built but hurts my feet. Arch is too low or something. Now after wearing them to work for around 2 months or so part of the sole is coming apart.Back to Red Wings it is...
This boots start off nice looks very good. But after 9 hours on my feet they were killing my feet. I think they would be at lot better for outdoor use.
Usually I am able to fit a men's size 10 shoe with no problems....This particular shoe ran really big....more like a 10 1/2 wide....I needed them for work....because the ones that my job issued were killing my feet....so unfortunately I wasn't able to return them....cause the wait would have been problematic. ....these shoes are definitely not true to size..and a little heavy too....but I guess that's due to them being really big...besides the large fit...they are pretty nice work boots.
Used to have the best price in town but now its gone up. But a great shoe.
It's a nice shoe. Well constructed but runs large and is a lot heavier than I expected.
Horrible boot. The insole feels hard as a rock and the top of the boot puts a pressure point on the top of my foot that leaves me in agony after a couple hours in them. Total waste of money for me.
"In general, I haven't found any affordable toddler shoes w better traction than the Merrells on Amazon. My toddler had the M-Trail Chaser Jr.  which he wore whenever we went on dirt/pebble trails (vs. his Nike sneakers ). However, they are heavier than these and I think less breathable because there's less mesh. (See side to side photo. This shoe model is in the foreground. M-Trail Chaser is in back of it). That being said, I think those may be more durable over time and more water resistant as these have more mesh which may tear more easily and let more water in, but we shall see. I also think these are slightly wider and easier to step into than the M-Trail Chasers.They claim these are machine washable which is nice though I would probably just spray them down w a hose.Hopefully you found this review helpful."
"Initially pleased with these shoes, but after only three months they are showing way more wear and tear than they should. Cloth around the top is fraying all around. My biggest concern though is wear metal loop that the start goes through. The loop is failing and looks like it will soon break rendering these shoes worthless.Update 3/2021: Velcro gave out, shoes falling apart, didn't even last a year. Super disappointed!"
"Be aware that the description is incorrect; these are NOT big kid sizes, they are little kid/toddler sizes."
We love these shoes for our girls! They are so sturdy and durable with great grip that makes them perfect for camping and hiking and even bike riding. They hold up so well they never look just destroyed like their other shoes do much more quickly with much less wear. We were excited to finally score a purple pair in the right size. But it’s always their go to shoe for any activity outside.
"Our daughter was jealous of her big sister's light-up shoes, but she needs a little more serious support. Once she got on her ""camper shoes,"" her mind was quickly changed. She says they are comfy and can easily get them on and off. While not as important, I appreciate that they look nice! Would purchase again."
"I printed Merrel's size chart, ordered the widest available. The length was perfect, the opening for the foot is stupidly small. The market for good outdoor shoes for toddlers is such that I really had no other option and chose to keep them. They haven't become any easier, i.e. they've not loosened. Or maybe the toddlers feet are just keeping up with that. Again, great traction on the sole for serious hiking and rough terrain... But they really could improve the ankle fit (maybe this is the width component of the shoe, but whatever it is, I hope buying next year's size isn't as hard as it was this year)."
Disappointed with the quality especially at this high price as the elastic cord came undone literally the first time this shoe was used. We decided to keep it as the shoe still seems to be functional and needed it immediately.Make sure to test the shoes you get before letting the kid wear them.
My 3 star rating might be a little harsh but I have little patience when it comes to frustrating children’s items. The shoes fit and my toddler seems to like them but even after purchasing the wide version they are very difficult to put on. There are plenty of shoes my 3 year old can put on herself but she definitely can’t do these... I barely can.
"I’m generally a lover Merrell shoes. So, of course I buy them for my children as well. I bought these for my son to use them on an extended camping trip (3.5weeks). He has a primary pair of Merrell shoes, and was going to wear these as his backup in case the others got wet. After one day of just walking around a state park (with minimal stress), I noticed that the front sole was coming apart. He wore these for a second day, and the sole was apart for a whole inch. I had to buy super glue. The picture shows the shoes after I glued them. We were still on our long camping trip and my son had to keep wearing the shoes so they are a little broken in now. Besides the sole coming apart at the toe, the shoes were great. This is the first Merrell shoe that I've been disappointed with. My son said that they were comfortable."
"Fits as expected. I bought them in 3.5 Wide size for my child, they were comfy and were gray for hiking in Yosemite. He loves them so much - that he wears them to school sometimes. These shoes really provide good support - for arch support and also helps with not pronating. My son has used these for only two weeks so Dont know how long it will last before the shoes get holes or components fall apart ( thatywhat happens to all his other pairs of shoes - from other big name brand.) Definitely recommend."
"Anfangs tat ich mich schwer, unterhalb des Knöchels hatte ich Blasen. Nach dem Einlaufen bin ich sehr zufrieden mit dem weichen Leder und der Sohle, die sich angenehm an meine Füße angepasst hat. Ich würde mir die Schuhe jederzeit wieder kaufen. Aufgrund dieser sehr guten Qualität sind sie ein echtes Schnäppchen."
"Desgraciadamente, este modelo no ha funcionado para mis pies anchos con hallux valgus. Estrecho. Tenía que devolverlas. Además, el color es realmente gris (bueno, el gris muy claro), no blanco como parece en las fotos."
Habe die Schuhe bestellt weil in der Beschreibung Passform Weit steht.Die Schuhe sind aber ganz normal Schmal. Sonst für den Preis schöne Echt Leder schuhe.
es passt einfach alles...
Super bequem
"Der Schuh qualitativ sehr hochwertig , für den Preis einfach toll !"
"Absolute Passform,weiches dennoch stabiles Material, auch mit Reißverschluss zu öffnen,sehr bequem!!!Würde diese Schuhe wieder kaufen!!!Es gibt"
"FAKE !!!!  these shoes are obviously a low-quality replica.  couldn't believe these are ""Sold By Amazon""."
This pair Of shoes it’s so good I like it
Very contrable and super affordable
Loved these shoes on my daughter but one shoe stopped lighting up after about 8 days. Returning.
The sneakers are really cute and my daughter loves them but they wore out quickly which I find is pretty typical for the Skechers I have purchased.
The lights on one of the shoes quit working. We’ve had the shoes only a week or so. My daughter is so disappointed
"Shoes are cute and fit just as expected, but the second time worn the lights stopped working on one shoe."
our daughter loves these shoes. She actually wakes up wanting to put them on to see them light up. thankfully we don’t have a downstairs neighbor :)
My daughter loves them and says they're so comfy.
Good price and she loves them
Our 5yr old kindergartener loves them! Lights on the bottom are really bright!
Great fit
Tip top
Tallaje segun tablas bien.
"This is my fourth pair.  Love them.  I walk about 4 miles a day and they last.  Kinda stiff  at first but breaks in quickly.  Sneakers sole is not flat, instead curved sole that you have to get use to if this is your first pair."
These are my favorite style of Reebok sneaker and they fit great I was thrilled to find them.
Daughter loves. She said they are comfy and true to size.
Authentic and as described.  Shipped in a timely manner
"These tennis shoes are great for hot days! Light, breathable and extremely comfortable."
"They were comfortable except the top part area, the tongue is so thin it hurt the top of my feet when I tied them. The material on those shoes is see through, I can see my socks! so I'm returning them."
"Comfortable, but they look longer and made my foot look like the size9 instead of 8."
"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Acaban de llegar y me gustaron mucho, los acabados y terminaciones perfectas, pedí una talla más pensando en que podrían salir pequeños soy 8.5 y pedí 9 😏 me quedaron grandes pero no importa"
"me encantaron, son muy cómodas."
Very comfortable for walking a lot.
"Auf Grund der anderen Bewertungen habe ich den Schuh für meine Tochter sicherheitshalber in zwei Größen zum anprobieren bestellt. Wir kaufen auch sonst oft Geox Schuhe, welche erfahrungsgemäß eher kleiner ausfallen. Diese sind aber wirklich riesig. Meine Tochter trägt derzeit Gr. 30, aber bei diesem Modell ist Gr. 29 noch zu groß. Also beide Paare retoure und wir versuchen es mit der 28 nochmal.(Wir hatten in der Vergangenheit schon mal das Modell in lila, da hatten wir das Größenproblem nicht).Ansonsten ist der Schuh (Geox entsprechend) gut verarbeitet. Die Sohle könnte in der Tat einen Tick weicher sein. Das Bild/die Applikation finde ich persönlich nicht so schön,  aber der Tochter gefällt es.Für den vollen Preis würde ich den Schuh nicht nochmal kaufen (da gibt es einfach bessere), aber reduziert im Angebot ein gutes Preis/Leistungs Verhältnis."
"Ein schöner Schuh, gute Qualität und atmungsaktiv. Das letzte Paar Geox Hausschuhe unserer Tochter hielt durch, bis sie rausgewachsen war. Sind gross gehalten, für Kinder mit schmalen Füssen, die zwischen zwei Grössen sind, lieber die kleinere wählen."
Comprato per mia figlia ma a distanza di circa un anno ancora non riesce a calzarli in quanto la misura secondo me non è corretta. Troppo grande nonostante abbiamo ordinato il numero giusto..speriamo almeno quest'anno di poter usarli. Il prodotto è comunque ottimo come fattura e materiali. Se trovate la taglia giusta lo consiglio. Do tre stelle solo per la misura a mio avviso non corretta
"Tolle Schuhe, hochwertig Verarbeitet, super Design, leider viel zu klein. Die Größe entspricht nicht der Tabelle."
"Größe wie angegebenWurden oft gewaschen, da sie im kiga getragen wurden. Sehr zu empfehlen. Super QualitätSchneller VersandSchöner Hausschuh"
Sehr schöne Schuhe. Sie sitzen sehr gut am Fuß und sind sehr bequem!
"Bin mir noch nicht sicher, auf den ersten Blick ist die Qualität so gut wie immer, aber die Innensohle ist so weich dass sie beim ausziehen der Schuhe immer nach vorne mitrutscht und das Kind die Schuhe dann ohne Hilfe nicht mehr anziehen kann.... das Problem hatte ich bis jetzt noch nie mit Geox Schuhen, deshalb vorerst nur 1 Punkt Abzug."
"Love the look, they run very small. I am a 10 1/2 to an 11. I got a size 11 and I need to go all the way up to at least a 12."
Sehr schöne Farbe. Sehr kräftig und ausdrucksstark.Form allerdings sehr klein. Der große Zeh stößt vorn an.Schade! Ging daher Retour.
"Ich frage mich, ob der Schuh für Mädchenfüße gemacht wurde, er fällt groß aus und ist breit geschnitten.Qualität, Farbe und design sind ok.Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis vollkommen in Ordnung."
"Son zapatillas de estar en casa muy confortables y de muy buen material. Trae el sistema anti-humedad de geox, lo cual es de agradecer. Forrada por dentro (no en exceso lo cual donde vivo se agradece). Cierre con velcro muy comodo y duradero. La suela es firme sin llegar a ser un zueco de madera, es algo que valoro bastante."
"Die schuhe haben die versprochene Qualität, der Preis ist unschlagbar und die Lieferung schnell und Porto-und Verpackungsfrei, obwohlder Preis unter 20,00 € ist. Die Ware ist neu und unbenutzt.Ich werde bestimmt bei diesem Anbieter wieder Schuhe bestellen."
"Très bonne qualité de pantoufles, ma fille sentait énormément des pieds dans les pantoufles achetées à Auchan ou autres magasins du commerce, certes la elles sont deux fois plus chères que des pantoufles ""normales"" mais vu la qualité du produit ça vaut vraiment le coup. La taille correspond parfaitement, le scratch ne s'est tjs pas usé apres 2 mois d'urilisation tous les jours, elles ne se déforment pas, elles sont anti dérapantes...bref, maintenant je n'achèterai que des pantoufles Geox pour ma fille ! Seul petit bémol : apres un passage en machine et au sèche linge, la semelle s'est légèrement décousue. Je déconseille de les mettre au sèche linge, laissez les sécher à l'air libre."
"La scarpa presenta una buona qualità a livello di suola e chiusura a strappo. Per quanto riguarda invece la comodità mi aspettavo un prodotto più morbido e confortevole mentre con mio grande dispiacere il materiale della scarpa è piuttosto rigido (soprattutto il suo interno). Ho scelto la scarpa con la certezza che Geox non ha mai disatteso le mie aspettative, ma questa volta mi sono dovuta ricredere...purtroppo..."
a little too big.
"Era un regalo pilotato, nel senso che erano state richieste esattamente queste scarpe. Sono arrivate e  sono state molto molto gradite"
"I colori non rispecchiano quelli della foto,toni molto più accesi.Il prodotto è comunque molto bello e comodo."
"Scarpe comodissime, spedizione arrivata in 2 giorni, molto prima del previsto! rapporto qualità prezzo eccellente."
"Scarpe molto comode, conveniente l’offerta... arrivato prima della data indicata"
"Scarpe arrivate in data prevista , ottimo prodotto"

Queste scarpe de la puma Meno di un mese e gia roto molto dispiaciuto
Ottimo
ottimo prodotto! la taglia è normale (se si conosce la propria taglia di scarpe puma la si può seguire tranquillamente)! arrivato in anticipo
The first pair I bought started squeaking when I walked. Paid $100.00 dollars for shoes. The shoes were over the return period but the shoes were defective. Amazon agreed to except return after I spoke to a person but they only refunded $88.25 so I lost $11.25 for buying defective shoes. They did give me a ONE TIME ONLY credit for $27.00.On products made and shipped by Amazon only.  So I will not buy shoes from Amazon again also makes me stronglyConsider if I want to continue my prime membership.
"Look great, but foot bed is super narrow with little support. Good for indoors and just walking but not for high intensity work outs. Also had to size up one full size, they run small."
"These shoes are light weight, comfortable and I walk ten miles a day at work and my feet are not hurting at the end of my shift. When I walk around I can feel the air though the top of the shoe I really like that, but stay away from wet weather."
"These are so perfectly comfortable!  This style is so comfortable, that I purchased 7 different pair in different color combinations over a few weeks. I totally enjoy them."
The shoes fit tight and was flimsy on the side
"Great comfortable shoes that keep your feet cool, with great cushioning and bounce in every step!"
Comodas y la calidad super buena.
"It runs smaller, very poorly glued together not worth $160."
"They first began to fall apart about 2 weeks into wearing them, all the yellow rubber simply fall off, it was put on with cheap glue.  I've warn them for 3 months now and they are barely holding together, the sole is completely falling apart, pieces hanging off it everywhere, and the seems are all coming undone.For only 3 months of use, I've never had a shoe fall apart so rapidly, do not buy these, they are complete junk and the return date only gives you 1 month."
"Es un calzado muy comodo, la suela es tipo memory foam y funciona muy bien. el interior esta bien acolchado y hace que no se sienta tanto el filo de la punta de acero. Buen ancho y el peso es aceptable."
"It took a couple of days to break it in, but now it feels very comfortable to wear all day long. They are also very solid and I think it will last long."
I use these for work in a shop. They are comfortable and breath well.
Comfortable and good fit
"maybe i should have gotten a size 9.5 us but i have been wearing size 9 for decades. also there is still an easy half an inch in front of my toe in the shoe, it pinches my big toes and pinky toes to the point where my right big toe is always numb and both pinky toes are well on their way to building corns (blister stage atm). to put it bluntly i cannot give this shoe a good review, maybe my feet are strange but i doubt it considering that i have never had problems like this with a shoe before. there is no way i would fit a 9.5 in this shoe, as i stated, the empty space in front of my toe is around and i think more than a half of an inch, which means that unless i really tighten up the shoe laces my foot slips forward and gets wedged even worse, with a gap behind my heel, the shoe can literally slip off if someone gives me a ""flat tire"". i know my feet might be a hair wide, but this is an unmitigated nightmare. i cannot recommend this shoe, i am stuck with it until i can afford another."
"These shoes are very comfortable. I've been wearing them every day at work for a couple months. Whether I'm out in the shop, at my desk, driving, or running errands they have been very comfy. So far I haven't seen any signs of them coming apart. I also put some of the elastic quick-laces on them because I have a hard time tying my shoes and they've worked very well. Sometimes with new shoes I'll get heel pain or pain on the top and bottom of my feet but that hasn't happened with these. The fact that they have safety toes and are water proof are a big plus also. I've been outside in puddles/mud and in the rain and my feet have stayed warm and dry. I'm not outside all day at work so I don't know how they'd hold up if you're constantly working in the wet cold weather."
"When I saw this and ordered them I was super excited because I LOVE Skechers shoes and flip flops. However, after a few weeks of wearing them the lining on the inside around the steel toe started to break and the steel toe started to rub up against my toes and made them bleed. At that point it was too late to return them to amazon and since I hadn’t bought them thru Skechers I was out of luck with them too. So this was a little frustrating because my feet are now have scars from this and it seemed like no one cared. If I could give zero stars I would."
"Truthfully, I would have returned these if I had to wear them all day long. Since I only wear them for an hour or 2 at a time when I visit work sites, I decided to keep them because I needed a warm weather safety shoe. The toe box is tighter than any other medium width shoe that I own, and the steel toes are poorly padded and uncomfortable. You are likely to find a better option with another brand or style. I am a Sketchers fan, and very disappointed in these shoes."
"KEEP IN MIND: These are waterproof and won't breathe, knew that going in but they will stifle your feet if you work indoors at length. Insoles love to collect moisture from your feet and aren't officially removable, though you can't yank them out halfway without much trouble. Which is a must, the memory foam starts dense and flat, and can't exhaust your metatarsal foot areas. Heavy  for the style but overall well built for the price. I wish Sketchers would stop gluing in the sub-par insoles."
"Die Schuhe fallen sehr klein aus, so dass man mindestens eine Größe größer bestellen muss. Ansonsten sind sie sehr bequem und vor allem für den Sommer bestens geeignet. Man kann einfach in sie hinein schlüpfen, da sie keine Schnürsenkel besitzen. Sie sind sportlich, können aber auch elegante zu einem Anzug getragen werden."
"Durch eine große Bauch-OP ""etwas"" eingeschränkt brauchte ich vor ein paar Wochen plötzlich Schuhe, die man sich auch ohne Bücken und Schnüren anziehen kann. Dabei auf dieses Modell gestoßen, testweise bestellt und begeistert gewesen. Das Reinschlüpfen funktioniert im Stehen, die Narbe darf sich weiter erholen.Aber nicht nur die Funktion überzeugt, auch die Optik spricht mir durchaus zu. Da man ja nicht tagtäglich die gleichen Schuhe tragen will/soll, stehen nun auch die Varianten in Grau & Schwarz hier. Und auch wenn's mit dem Bücken demnächst wieder funktioniert - die Dinger werden getragen, bis die Sohle durch ist;)Preis/Leistung geht für mich voll in Ordnung."
"Die Schuhe haben ein kräftiges Rot, was schon gut auffällt.Die Qualität der Schuhe ist auch gut, habe die jetzt einen guten Monat und die halten so wie am ersten Tag.Bin zufrieden und vergebe hier 5 Sterne."
"Die angegebene Schuhgröße 43 entspricht nicht der Realität. Viel zu klein!Die gelieferten Schuhe entsprechen eher der Größe 41.Die Lieferanten sollten die Produkte besser prüfen, bevor sie in den Verkauf gehen."
komme mit dem fuß erst gar nicht rein weil es zu eng ist
"Leise und absolut keine Streifen hinterlassende Sohlen! Ideal als Hausschuhe. Die Qualität ist halt Kunststoff, aber für den Preis durchaus okay!"
"Der Schuh entspricht eben seinen Preis, man merkt die nicht allzu hohe Qualität.Für Laufschuhe ist die Sohle auch nicht sehr biegsam und es fühlt sich sehr Starr mit dem Schuh an."
"Lieferung sehr schnell, Schuhe sehen aus wie auf dem Bild , aber viel zu klein .... habe 46 bestellt ist aber eher 44 oder so .... schade"
Finde die Schuhe schauen sehr gut aus aber sie sind leider etwas zu klein trotz der richtigen Angabe 😅
Schöner Schuh. Gute Passform fällt aber klein aus am besten wie ich gleich eine Nummer größer bestellen.
"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Scarpe morbide e la suola è di una comodità infinita. Le uso a lavoro dove macino parecchi km e arrivo a sera che non ho le gambe affaticate. Qualità molto buona"
Super👍
"Prodotto già conosciuto e testato, perfetto per la spiaggia."
Sehr bequem
Feel great!
"Yes, I usually wear a size 10 US shoe, as well as in sandals, but in Reefs I wear a Size 9 US and they're perfectly comfortable every time, and they don't slip off my feet when I walk.  They're just a tiny bit snug but that's why I like them - they hug my feet and are never loose, and they're never ever uncomfortable.  It's a perfect hug!  I own 7 pairs of Reefs in different models and I'm consistently a size 9 US.  Never been disappointed.  And, they last a long time.  Buy with confidence from them."
"This is my 3rd pair of Reefs, I decided to go with the Tri Waters since they look good.Had them for 2 months now, use them almost every day BUT they are worthless when wet, the minute you get out of the pool, lake, river, or get them wet in any way they are BAD, there is no grip, you feet slide all over the sandal. I would not recommend this particular model. With the name Tri Waters I was expecting a way better sandel. Time to look at other brands."
True to size. Fits perfectly. I wear 7 in women’s and ordered 6. Very sturdy and form-fitting. Highly recommend
"It’s not true to size, run to smal"
Buyer beware! Only buy if you have skinny narrow feet
These sandals were 1/2 size too small compared to the regular Reefs we get.
Muy bueno
"Son muy bonitas, y la piel parece de buena calidad, pero la suela es mas delgada de lo que aparenta y no creo que vayan a ser todo lo comodas que yo esperaba."
La zapatilla era bonita pero la devolví porque era pequeña. Su número no se corresponde con la numeración habitual. Al intentar comprar un número mayor el precio subía mucho.
Perfectas. Llegaron el día previsto
Très belle basket
Très belles et confortable pie un peu transpire mais sinon super
"Oh my god, I had plantar fasciitis and was getting better. I got these shoes and they literally killed my feet, one month later I am still feeling the affects. These shoes are not for people with issues with their feet."
"I really like these. Quite comfortable and seem to have decent stability,  which I need in a shoe since I over pronate. Like the colour and fit and they seem to grip the trail pretty well!"
Ordered 6.5 but it was a tight fit. Exchanged them for a pair of 7. Really great service from Adrien at Wooki. Got new pair in no time!
"I love that shoes. I have bunions and I was able to walk with pain.Unfortunately, I can't find my size any more."
"Very nice, but 1 was a bit snugger.Trying to break it in and hoping it stretches a bit"
Ankle supportGood grip
Fits excellent.
Top Notch Product and I have bought again.
The product itself is A+ but I'm not sure why they deliver the wrong shoe size.
Love these shoes they are so comfortable and the colors are great.
"I really love the fit and look of these shoes, but I ordered them in taupe and what I received looks much closer to olive green. The olive green color isn’t included in the available options, so I thought at first that maybe the color was really off from what’s advertised. But then I noticed that an olive green perforated slip on is included next to the taupe slip on in one of the pictures, so I think the seller just sent the wrong color. The ones I’ve ordered do fit well (I’m an 8 and they’re true to size), and they’re really comfortable. Hopefully, if I reorder them in taupe, I’ll get the right color this time, and I can bump this up to a five star rating. If not, then the taupe color is really off from what they’ve said it is."
"I bought the snakeskin type and they fit perfectly. So, I ordered the pink which are gorgeous but, unfortunately, did not fit the same as the snakeskin ones, the pink were just a little too big."
"Well made, right-sized, reasonably priced, incredibly comfortable and nice-looking. I immediately ordered a second pair."
Soft and comfortable. Fits perfect! I wear a size 9 and I order a size 9 and it fits great. Very neat
"Super cute sneakers that are comfy to wear all day. The only issue I have with these shoes is the awful smell. I didn’t notice any smell at first, but after wearing them once I now notice a strong rubber, slightly fishy smell inside the shoes. Maybe the ones I ordered are defective because I didn’t see any other reviews mentioning this issue, but I can’t wear them because the smell gives me a headache."
"I wear these without socks and they feel big. If I wear my cotton socks they feel like they fit my feet perfectly (size 8). Love these shoes but if you like to wear thin socks, maybe order a half size down"
"I purchased these shoes during my pregnancy and was constantly on my feet. They are extremely comfortable. However color is off. I ordered black, but these shoes are not a true black. They’re more charcoal."
"Cushiony bottom, soft top and sturdy sole. Great style, perfect fit, comfortable shoe."
super cute and comfy!...  i own several pairs of Jenn Ardor shoes and love each of them!  you can't go wrong with them in my opinion
Part of the white trim on these shoes turned pink after two months.  They were worn 3 times.  They were returned.
These flats are really comfortable for my wide feet. I ordered a regular 9.5 since the wide wasn't available. These don't squish my toes unlike other shoes. I can wear it with thick socks. I would have tried 9W but it wasn't available and the 9.5 works well as the toe box is wide.
"The shoes are great. Deep enough for my inserts.  The Velcro closure is very easy to put on or take off. I am wearing them constantly,Being elderly, they will make a difference, as I had a fall recently.MOui"
"Los compre para un adulto mayor, no resbalan, son comodos y suaves"
Son súper cómodos y fáciles de limpiar sólo que vienen un poco grandes.
very comfortable  - soft letter!!  will buy other pair later!!
"I needed shoes that were comfortable, had arch support, fit my difficult feet, and looked nice and professional for work. I'm young and a lot of shoes that fit the bill aren't cute, but these look good and as a bonus they work great with socks (especially fun ones that poke through the cut outs.) I walk several miles a day in them, and they were comfortable from day one. I find myself reaching for them everyday when picking out what to wear. This is the first pair of shoes I've found that I can't find a single complaint with- I've already picked out the next pair of Propet shoes I'm going to buy."
These Propet shoes are comfortable. I ordered a 10 narrow.  I normally wear a 10 but measure a AAA rather than a AA so I knew these shoes might be a bit wide. They fit well with heavier socks. I can add an insole and wear them with tights or light socks. They do not have as thick cushioning or as much arch support as SAS Roamers but for one third the price they are good and comfortable shoes. They do not have a deep toe box. That doesn't bother me but it might be an issue for some.
"Purchased for my mother, who needs good support.  She has the other style propet’, Mary Jane, and really likes them.  Took a chance on a slightly different style and she loves them.  They fit true to size, stay on with no heel slipping, good traction on bare floors.  The shoe does not rub or cut the foot as some new shoes may.  Very comfortable from the start.  Definitely recommend!"
Love my Propet shoes! I recently purchased this style for fall/winter.The material is a suede-like brushed leather upper. Soft and pretty in black.The insole is very cushiony!I wore them to the grocery yesterday just to try them out. They are much too snug across the top of my feet.  When I took them off my feet were swollen.  I'm keeping them in hopes they will stretch out a bit.8w
"These shoes are very comfortable. I am a greeter at church and they are super comfortable. I have Neuropathy, Fibromyalgia and Arthritis, so I need good and comfortable shoes."
"Las he tenido que domar. Las primeras puestas me hicieron una rozadura en el dedo chico por una costura interior. Uno pensaría que una marca de prestigio tendría mas experiencia con estos detalles.Una vez que la zapatilla se ha hecho a mi pie, y dicha costura está más aplastada y suave van bien. Son algo duras pero bien.Eso sí, estéticamente me gustan mucho."
"Le scarpe di per sé non sono male, ma dopo due sole settimane dall'utilizzo, si è staccata la suola sulla scarpa sinistra e non c'è modo di rimetterla a posto. Pur sistemandola, dopo un po' si stacca nuovamente."
"Un marchio del genere dovrebbe vergognarsi di vendere un prodotto del genere. Praticamente devastate dopo dieci utilizzi.Completamente scollati i bordi attorno alla suola, l'ultima volta a lavoro stavo per restare scalzo.Mai più scarpe levi's."
La suola on gomma è leggermente pesante. Bella la tomaia con i disegno dei colibrì. Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo
Se ajuntan a su numero tal cual y son cómodas
Lo que yo quería para el conjunto
perfecto todo muy atentos y muy factible
"Schön, aber nicht bequem."
Good productGood fit
"I've been buying Reebok's, specifically the RealFlex Reebok's, for the last 5 years and they keep updating their models and coming out with different new versions of the RealFlex shoes. I understand that they're a company and that they need to keep changing the model to come out with bigger, better product, but it's honestly such a pain to try and find new running shoes all over again when I can no longer find the style I like. I bought these in a 7 since my last pair was a 7 and they just fit different. They're really tight and narrow, and I don't even have a wide foot. They also run really small, so I'm not sure if I'd need a 7.5 or an 8. I can usually buy my Reebok's on Amazon no problem, especially when they're just the newer version of RealFlex, but this time I can't be lazy and have to go to various shoe stores and look for a pair. If you're used to the older styles of RealFlex I'd wait on ordering these online and try and find a retailer that carries them so you can try them on in person."
"I am a big fan of these shoes! Cannot even describe how much I love these- could go on and on...Great cushion support at the gym- I use them for cardio, cross training,lifting,hiking etc.. I own a pair of 1st generation so I was eager to find these shoes. I was very nervous because I read the reviews about the fit.  I ordered these in a 7 1/2 (my normal size) and found them to be VERY comfortable! So much so, I am afraid I will not find these anymore so ordering another pair! Order your normal size, these are true to fit and wonderful!*Update*I just got my 2nd pair (blue) and will be ordering the grey next. These shoes live up to everything you love about these if you own the 1st Generation of Realflex. I ordered my normal 7 1/2 and the fit is great."
"I have been searching high and low for the right Zumba shoe. If you search the web, the most recommended Zumba shoes are light, and flexible, with smooth soles to allow for toe spins and dance moves. I've tried many of the most recommended shoes (Ryka, Asics, Nike, New Balance) but as I'm getting older, I feel less comfortable jumping without more support and cushion in my shoe. I tried the Reebok Trainettes, which I really like, but not enough support, Nike's are too narrow for my foot, which cause my feet to feel numb during class. I tried a more supportive running shoe, but it was too 'sticky' on the studio floor. Anyway, just back from my favorite Zumba class, and these seem to be the right balance of support that also allows for dance moves. Give them a try if you deal with any of these issues."
"These are the BEST shoes! I am a martial artist who enjoys running, and I need a shoe that allows me to use my foot muscles as I run. Most running shoes' soles are so thick and bulky my foot cannot flex for a proper running midfoot/forefoot strike. These cushion the landing while still allowing natural movement. They also do not have arch support, which lets me strengthen my arches through proper use. I have run up to 10 miles in these, worn all day at a theme park, done Zumba/fitness class... everything in these shoes."
"I have a few 10.0 from Reebok and they are size 9.  Amazon sizing recommended an 8.  I was skeptical so I read the reviews and reached out to the community.  Mixed reviews and responses so I took Amazon’s suggestion and ordered an 8.  To my surprise they fit and as expected comfortable.  Someone mentioned arch support, no not all all but I really like these shoes for cross training.  I wish shoe company’s would have one standard size.  Then vary the narrow and wide, clothes too!"
I had the Realflex 4.0 Cross Trainers and they worked great.  The 5.0 version is completely different.  I ordered the same size as the 4.0 (7.5) and it was about 1/2 inch longer measuring side by side and much narrower.They are very cute and will wear them for running short errands but not suitable for my HIIT workouts and weight training like the 4.0’s were.  The heel slipped inside the shoes when doing burpees and planks.  Did not support.Tried walking my dog in them today for about an hour and it pinched my pinky toe and was painful.
"I work long hours on my feet— constantly on the move, rarely stopping— and these shoes are a MIRACLE! I hope they never discontinue this style because shoe shopping for work makes me all anxious and I FINALLY found my “sole” mate."
The shoes are comfortable but if I am not in constant motion they cut off the circulation on the top of my feet. No matter how loose they are tied (or not tied) the shoe is tight and almost elastic on top. Fit great everywhere else thought. And it’s too late to send them back. Meh. I Don’t love them but I don’t hate them either.
"Ordered 9.5. Every other shoe fits perfectly at that size. These were too big, and unfortunately I'm past the return window. Second time with Reebok and disappointed with size and quality. I'll stick with New Balance"
Love these shoes! I have Plantar’s Fasciitis and these supportive sneakers are perfect for reducing foot pain. I can walk miles in them. Nice looking and light weight compared to other supportive sneakers. Fit as expected.
"Hab viele von Legero, als SneakerDieser ist Mal was Anderes auch bequem und für meinen schmalenFuss prima geeignet, super zufrieden.Größe Gr38 passt wie immer"
Ich kaufe seit Jahren nur Schuhe von Legero und bin immer zufrieden - gute Passform und tolles Aussehen!
Super Schuhen!
"I have been using Nike and adidas running shoes for the past 10 years. After going through the top men running shoes I decided to buy ASICS gel-Kayano 27 for 170$ Which higher price from any of my previous running shoes. I started using it and after the first run I started to get annoyed because the shoes is either too tight tight or to loose , after couple of runs I started to get irritation on the bottom of my feet which ended up to painful blisters.From my experience the shoes is too expensive for what it offers , it’s not comfortable , fit is very irritating abd caused me a lot of pain to the point that I went back to use my two years old shoes that is still more comfortable than the new 170$ shoes .Not recommended , over priced !!!"
"I’ve been a fan of ASICS kayano and this is my third pair. This one I’m not a fan of. The pair I have are comfortable for the bottom of my feet, but VERY uncomfortable on the top. I have to wear the laces way loose. Otherwise they start to hurt my feet. Not sure it it’s a defect. It seems like it.Insole is pretty good and so is the cushioning. So disappointed with how they fit the bridge of my feet. Never had this problem before with any shoe."
"I've used Gel Kayanos for over 10 years, and the 27s are a great improvement over the 26s. I also really like the colors of the Lite-Show version. My wife even noticed and said how sharp they looked.HOWEVER, Asics put the wrong sized laces onto these shoes! I can barely tie them because they're so short. I have another pair of 27s that have normal sized laces. Not sure how that happened, but that's a very annoying mistake! And getting in touch with Asics customer service is very difficult to get a new pair of laces."
"I had a pair of Kayano’s a few versions ago.  They were the best shoe I’ve had.  Just the right combination of support, cushioning and ground feel.  I literally ran the soles off of them.These are a different story.  I might as well be running in tap shoes as hard as these soles are.  It’s like running on boards.  You can’t feel what’s going on between your feet and ground and even a 3 mile run feels like an effort.  The fit is expected.  The “support” is fine, but they need to remove whatever kind of material they put in these soles."
"I’ve been running Ascis Kayanos non stop since 2010.  I’ve gone through probably over 15 pairs and they are usually perfect.These ones suck.I was hoping there was just a break in period, but they actually got worse. My toes touch, the laces are too short, and they just don’t feel the same when pounding the pavement.I even looked into if these were knock-offs or counterfeit but it seems like everyone has similar experiences. Which is a shame. I hope the next models are better."
"I have worn 9.5 M men's Asics Kayano for years--like more than a decade. I usually take to Amazon to buy last year's model. I liked this shoe b/c of the glow features. This shoe runs very narrow. I visited my local running store, lucked up and found an Asics Kayano from 2019. Mens size 9.5 M. Fits like every other pair I have owned."
"Shoes are great. However, the shoestrings are WAY too short. I'll just steal some from my previous Kayano's."
"Feels and looks great.  Laces are a little bit short for my liking, but all in all a great buy."
"New feel. If they hold up, I'm going to really like."
Exactly as described and comfortable
"tempi oke calzata io che sono 37.5 il 37 mi è calzato a pennello....oltre alla qualità che ottima, ed il comfort pure ...."
"I ordered these for work, since they are black I Figured they would blend in with my work pants better than the other bright asics I have. Now, be warned, these are not super supportive or comfortable like other asics can be. I am a runner and have many pairs, much more expensive, gel lined ones and these are not at all like those.  They are good for a few hours but not what I consider to be a ""Disneyland shoe"". (It's what we call shoes that you can walk around in all day). The look is pretty good but I don't know if I would buy them again."
"I got these in the gray/red scheme. Great looking shoes but they are a tad darker than pictured. Very lightweight and surprisingly supportive and cushioned for this type of shoe. As always I ordered these Asics 1/2 a size up to get the right length but the toe boxes are still too narrow for me to rate these as all day wearers. I took away one star because I feel they are a little expensive and another star for the narrow toe box issue but again, these are undeniably great lookers that go with anything and have great cushioning."
Ordered a half size up and the width is perfect but they are a little long.Great quality. Better support than most casual sneakers. Comfortable but the sole is a little stiffer than I expected after hearing about Asics infamous Gel midsoles.
Didn't really like these once received.  The size was a bit small and the colors didn't look as good together in person.  The while base was kind of obnoxious as well...
"Purchased for son as a parkour shoe. Parkour shoes tend to be expensive and low quality; these sneakers have excellent treads, are light weight, cost less, and are very well made."
Feet savers!! So comfy and great for my tired feet. Lot of cushion in the heel and I suffer from mild plantar fasciitis and these shoes provide relief
Great shoe and the quality/durability that I would expect from ASICS.
they stretched after wearing so while i normally wear a 9 i wish i had gotten an 81/2
they're just a little narrow.
These shoes are very comfortable and are great for those of us with wide feet.
"They are very stiff, about 1/2 size too large, so you should size down as well as wide width feel more like Extra, extra wide."
Cute shoe but they run large.
"Wir können vom Kauf dieser Schuhe nur abraten. Unsere Tochter hat sie vielleicht 20 Mal getragen, nun habe ich ein nicht sehr kleines Loch in der Sohle entdeckt. Die Sohle scheint nicht aus ""einem Guss"" zu sein, sondern die unterschiedlichen Farben sind anscheinend ""zusammengefügt"", zwischen Schwarz und Türkis löst sie sich  nun auf.Wir hatten die Schuhe eigentlich gekauft, da sie laut Produktbeschreibung wasserabweisend sein sollen. Leider ist das nicht der Fall, selbst bei leichtem Nieselregen werden die Socken auf dem 10-minütigen Schulweg nass."
Der Schuh passt perfekt! Die Einlegesohle ist rausnehmbar.Fazit nach 2 Monaten ist der Schuh kaputt!! Ausgerissen an der Halterung vom Klettverschluss. Schade
Nach 8 Wochen sind die Schuhe schon hinüber. Die Sohle nutzt sich extrem schnell ab und das Material aus dem die Schuhe sind macht keinen guten Eindruck nach 8 Wochen jeden Tag anziehen.Leider keine Empfehlung
Die Schuhe fallen größengerecht aus und eignen sich sehr gut für den Sportunterricht draußen.
Preislich perfekt etwas fest/steif die Schuhe aber denke nach mehrmals anziehen werden die weicher. Kind hat sich gefreut. Trotz breite Füße haben die gepasst. Da die schon schmal ausschauen..
"Leider ist nach einer Woche in Gebrauch die Klettverschlussschnalle an der Naht abgerissen.Ich werde die Schuhe nun noch mal umtauschen. Vielleicht haben wir dann mehr Glück, denn mein Sohn findet die Schuhe ansonsten gut."
"Light weight, comfy and good-looking shoe for kids"
Sehr gut verarbeitet. Passform sehr gut. Preis-Leistung wunderbar.
Leider nach nur wenigen Wochen komplett abgelaufen. Das hatten wir bisher noch nie und wir laufen schon immer sehr viel.
"Top Schuh,  passt in der Größe wie angegeben."
Buena compra.comodas y super bonitas para vestir arreglada.
son como esperaba
"Very pleased with these Merrell Alverstone hiking shoes. I have flat and wide feet and ordered 1/2 size up from my usual and it's a comfortable fit. No more black toenails from smashing toes against the front of my shoe (yes, lacing the shoestrings correctly helps also). The Alverstone sole isn't as deeply grooved as the Moabs, and the Alverstone do not have the vibram sole, but I also paid $20 less for these shoes. I hope the Alverstones will last much longer than my Fila and Saucony walking shoes where the soles gets worn-out smooth after a 4-5 months of hiking once a week.I'm saving up money for a pair of $100 Merrell Moabs for better traction and grip. Merrell makes shoes that fit the shape of my feet; it's very hard to find comfortable and durable shoes that look good, as well. I want everything, haha!I purchased my Alverstones from Gear Coop, good seller. Earlier, I had bought the shoes from Zappos but got a defective/previously-returned item; one of the heels squeaked! Amazon took it back and gave me a refund, but I didn't want the return hassle to begin with."
I find this shoe brand/style to be very comfortable and I receive many complements as well. The she fits perfectly and I find it to be perfect for hiking in the mountains and wearing on the city streets. It keeps my feet nice and warm in cold weather too. Highly recommend.
"If you have a short, boxy foot this is a good shoe. I prefer the old Moab Ventilators that are true to size. Perhaps if I size up a half size..., but I'm just returning them for the old Moab's."
"These shoes are well made. Merrell is a good quality company. One tip for these shoes is that the arch insert can move a little in such a way that they become squeaky, but there is an easy fix: just adjust the insert and all is quiet again."
Most comfortable shoes I ever had! I work 8 to 10 hrs a day..These do not have to be broken in..Wear them all day straight out of the box!
Really do like the shoes
I love my shoes!
"Me encanta, es de buena calidad y el color es muy bonito. El vendedor muy serio tb"
"Arrivate prima del previsto! Scarpe davvero comode, come se camminassi a piedi nudi. 🔝🔝"
"Son unos zuecos muy cómodos y ligeros, no pesan nada. Para estar todo el día con ellos."
"Für den Sommer perfekt, atmungsaktiv und auch für breite Füße nicht eng,  allerdings würde ich eher 1 Größe größer bestellen"
"Bonne chaussures,agréable pour l'été"
"In spite of their listed policy of Prime shipping and FREE returns, they don't actually offer this. They will charge you shipping at checkout and you will pay shipping back to China if you decide to return. It's too bad because the shoes themselves seem pretty legit and comfy."
"They seem to be very nice, they run a little larger than the size, so they were too big for my grandson, I just kept them hoping they won't be too small next year"
"1 size too big for my daughter, the straps is soft but still too big. But breaths well for her sweaty feet in the summer and it still stays on for bike riding so will keep it."
Nice
"My son is 3 and he loves these shoes, he wants to wear them with everything!"
"I can hardly wait for warmer weather so I can wear my new sneakers, fantastic and they are so comfortable."
"These are my second pair, and they're super comfy once they stretch out a bit!"
"Super Cute, but get a half size up."
They are a medium width shoe which worked for me great!
Love them
"Bought 2 pairs, navy blue and the khaki colored ones. I wear shoe inserts so I took the advice from another review and easily pulled out the padding and slipped in my insert. They fit perfectly. I have wide feet and these fit great. I actually ended up unknotting the laces and pulled them tighter, reknotting them. Really cute, stylish, casual shoes. So far, happy I bought them."
"Like: cute, cushiony, breathable material, fits wide feet, can wear without socks - no smelly feet! Comfortable for all day wearDislike: runs about a size small, material on bottom of inside shoe comes up at the top by your toesI did buy a second pair a half size up to see if they fit better, upon wearing the shoes through out the day the size I ordered may have worked fine but it still is about a size small- received second pair, still to small, might try another half size up.When ordering, order about 1 size bigger"
Most comfortable casual shoe I've ever worn. My job requires me to walk for 2 hours at lunchtime with children.  I have plantar fasciitis.  After walking 2 hours I dont have any arch pain. The shoes fit perfectly and are very stylish!!
"I wear these very cute shoes for just hanging around, shopping, outdoors activities.  They never disappoint for being the right fit (I have several pairs) and I can wear them all day in comfort. They are so well made I know that I will never wear them out."
"I wear a 7 and ordered a 7, they are super comfortable, I believe a little on the wide side.  I think I would be happier if they had enough shoestring to tie.  If your foot is just a tad wider than mine than you will love these shoes."
Muy bonito. Muy cómodo. Muy bueno
Muy bonitas y elegantes. Muy buenos materiales y acabados
"Très belles chaussures, très confortables, pointure juste.J'en suis très satisfait !"
"The shoes were great, however I was a bit disappointed that they didn't have half sizes. I am normally an 8.5, so I decided to play it safe and order a size 8. I am very glad I didn't order size 9 because the size 8 is a little big. I had to tighten up the laces when I first got them so the heel wouldn't slip off every time I took a step. The shoes themselves are great, but the sizing was a little off."
"Product meet expectations. Very comfortable, and loved the color too."
Comfy & So Cute!
These are so cute and a great dupe. However they are very cheap and kill your feet. The leather was sewed together very strange on the inside causing the sides to always dig in your foot. Three steps and they killed your feet. Also I am usually an 8 and I ordered and 81/2 because everyone said to size up and they still were too small.
"These were so cute and looked like a great dupe of the higher end sneaker brands, but unfortunately not right for me! First they were too wide for me - I’m a size 6.5 usually and ordered my usual size but they were super wide on my foot, and I have an average foot width. Then there were some quality issues: the tongue felt flimsy like it might rip off, no cushion in soles, and some sort of little plastic piece digging into the side of my foot on the left shoe only. I only wore them in my house for a minute before I knew I’d be returning. Such a shame, because they’re super cute! Maybe I just got a bum pair."
Ordered the rose gold star sneakers for my daughter and we are both really happy with them. She’d seen another brand in boutiques that looked exactly the same for double the price.  She’s had them since the spring and they still look great.
"Just got these today in the mail,  and they look terrific on me. Can't wait to wear them soon. They fit perfect and the colors are amazing. Glad I bought them."
"Perfect shoe! Comfortable, true to size and tons of cushioning! They are honestly the same look and quality of a high-end designer shoe! Purchased the leopard/white 7.5 and LOVE them !"
Hands down the best golden goose dupes around!  came superquick great price great quality great fit
"I ordered a size up because of other reviews. They fit perfectly, and are super cute, however, they are not comfortable, so I would rec not wearing if you are walking a lot.  Will try an insert and see if that helps."
The shoes are great quality and very cushioned on your feet. I love them. The fit on them is a little snug on my toes but I feel like it will stretch out with wear and not enough to want to size up.
Perfect shoe and true to size! I wear these all the time!!
I loved em just wish I would’ve went a size up!
"I had to return my original order, size 46 (my usual equivalent for a U.S. size 13), and get size 47 instead.  At first even this larger size felt narrow, but after a few days of serious walking, they became more comfortable. They were the only pair of walking shoes I took on a three week tour which involved a lot of walking and stair climbing, the provided good arch support, and they remained comfortable.  If they ever got dirty, I could clean them up with just a quick wipe with a damp cloth.  I'm now very happy with them."
"These are great shoes.  They are snug and are not going to slip off.  Very comfortable clean leather sneakers to dress up or down.I like them so much I've now bought three pair.As other reviewers have noted, size up one.  Originally I ordered 46 as I do for other makers and they were too tight.  47 is just right."
"Update 8/27/2020 still going strong. Did have to put in a sole in the shoe as the synthetic sole isn’t too great at releasing foot sweat... but Lysol em down and they’re good. Still just as comfortable as when I got them.At first I was a little worried about these shoes. They were a little snug across the top of my foot when I first put them on. But after the first day, no issues. I am on my feet 9-12 hours a day with minimal down time. No tired feet at the end of the day. They have been exceeding my expectations"
"They fit as expected, very comfortable for someone who stands on their feet all day or just walking in... cleans easily and look great"
"The shoes were purchased as a birthday gift for our son.  He wears a straight size 9 and size 9 was listed as a size to choose from.  Size 8 1/2-9 was not even an available option for purchase yet that is what we received.  Unfortunately, when he tried the shoes on they were very uncomfortable ~ very tight at the heel and no room at the toe.  They are a good looking shoe and are well made.  Too bad sizing isn't correct."
"I was disappointed in the fact that these were too tight in the toe box for my husband. He needs good shoes, and often complains about his feet hurting, so I got these for him. I’m a Dansko diehard-I love their women’s casual shoes.The toe box was much too tight, but he liked everything else about the shoes."
Great shoe. I love the dáñskos. But this particular model was more snug than others at same size. Suggest to size up one level compared to other dansko models. Looking for a bigger size of same model
"Hubby loves these shoes!  They are comfortable and he can wear them just about anywhere.  He is in steel toed work boots all day so as soon as he comes home, it's off with the boots and on with the Danskos!  They arrived quickly and in good shape."
This was the second time of buying the same shoe. My husband enjoys wearing dansko shoes and likes he can wear these with just about everything. They are his daily work shoes.
Fits well in the toe and heel but they're a little tight on top and sides. Still comfortable though
good fit for price
"Great shoes for the money. If you have wide feet like me they might not fit properly. The first 1-2 weeks were a little snug over the top of my feet but eventually they broke in nicely. Not a bad shoe for $30, but wish they offered them in wide like their website shows."
Excellent. Just a bit tight for wide feet like mines. Overall I love them for the price I got them for!I have 5 pairs different colors and one is wide kind. Those were extremely comfortable. But they are now my water shoes lol
They feel tight and my feet are tired of I wear them too long. They look great and for the gym will work fine. But I won't wear them for more than a few hours.
"I wear a 13 regular width, and these are good in the length, but slim overall making them a tight fit.I am/was really disappointed with the cushion since they only lasted about 40 days walking daily.Because of the slim fit, I found my feet/legs were getting fatigued walking in them.Wouldn't buy again and honestly wish I could return them."
"I though these were great looking shoes, but even after reading reviews and adjusting the size I ordered, the shoes run to narrow for me. I do have a wider foot, but don't normally have an issues buying sneakers.So I would recommend the shoes but be cautious of the size you order. They did allow for a return with no problem."
The grey color is not too dark as you can see in the product picture. But they are amazing. Super soft and comfortable. I’m happy.
the grey is much lighter than shown in the pictures
Quedan perfecto pero pero para personas con el empeine fino para personas con pies gruesos la van a ver difícil son angosto ami me quedó perfecto soy pie fino pedí talla 7Muy buenos zapatos
"Seems to be just a tad narrow towards the front of the foot.  Otherwise, pretty comfortable and good cushion.  I use this for indoor workouts (cross fit, P90x, Insanity)."
"Perfetta la calzata ..., bellissime e comode . Il colore nella fato inganna però perché sono un giallo non così acceso (in foto sembrano quasi fluo)  in realtà è un giallo sole"
"Hay un defecto en la configuración cuando seleccionas el color del producto. Compré el color rosa claro artic y en la confirmación de compra me aparecío la foto del color arena. He tenido que solicitar la devolución porque no correspondía al color seleccionado inicialmente por mí; ha sido aceptada, espero recuperar pronto mi dinero. Realmente no es un problema de los vendedores ni del producto entiendo, supongo que es mas bien incidencia de Amazon, pero es un gran inconveniente porque debes tramitar la devolución del producto, esperar el reembolso del dinero y además te quedas sin tu compra."
"Schuh wurde geliefert, nur leider in einer Falschen Farbe..  Ich würde empfehlen bessere Fotos rein zu stellen.."
War ein Geschenk für mein Sohn hat mich gestern mit geteilt wie warm und bequem seine Neue Convers sind. Mfg Olinda Maria Nunes Martinho Radinger
"Bellissimo modello, bel colore e resistenti all’acqua !! Comode e ben fatte !!"
"Molto carine e particolari,con un buon prezzo e arrivare subito"
"Très bon produit au meilleur prix mais mauvaise taille.Echanges très rapides et complets avec service clients, retour produit et remboursement parfaits !Je recommande vraiment pour la grande importance aujourd'hui du SAV !!!!"
"Der Schuh passt wie erwartet, trage ihn fast täglich und zeigt noch keinerlei Veränderung. Bin super zufrieden damit."
Buon prodotto
"Super suivie, échange car trop grand, réaction de la vendeuse très rapide, et suivie aussi, Merci !"
"Der Schuh passt ganz genau, ist leicht und hat eine tolle Qualität"
Ancora più belle che in foto... La piccolina a adorato i suo primi infradito 😉
"Une première paire de tong pour ma fille très bien ! De qualité, sobres mais sophistiquées, il n'y a rien à redire sur ces petites chaussures !"
Très bon produit. Taille un peu grand
Idéal pour le pied de ma fille de 4 ans. La sangle à l’arrière permet de maintenir le pied.
"Bought these sandals for my niece. Super cute. Reefs are my favorite. Very comfortable. They do run a little big but that's the great thing about toddlers, if they dont quite fit today...they will tomorrow!"
I always buy my kids reef flip flops! They last all season and can be passed down to siblings or sold!! They are worth the few extra bucks!
Love these shoes for my 3.5 year old daughter. She has always had wide feet as well as chunky so finding shoes that fit her has always been a challenge. Even flip flops since if there is not enough give in the straps they cut into the tops of her feet. We have been buying her reef stargazer flip flops for the past year and they are perfect.
perfect little flippys for a perfect little beach princess
Love all these Reef sandals. This style is another cute one. My daughter loves these styles and they are comfy.
Great shoe but the glitter wore off in the first couple of days of wear.
"Der Verkäufer hat mich kontaktiert in Bezug auf die Schuhgröße und super nett beraten. Der Schuh passt super, ich hätte sonst die falsche Größe bestellt.Ganz tolle Beratung und sehr schneller Service."
"Der Schuh ist dehnbar, dadurch ich gut laufen."
bought these a little over a year ago.. love them! im a 7 1/2 & they were true to size. i have a wide foot though so they were a bit tight but they've stretched out to my size. think ill be buying these again soon
Kinda tight fit but could have got up a size
Me gustos mucho el calzado
Muy bien
"Love these so much, I just ordered them in black.I have ""problem"" feet, I have a relatively narrow heel, but need a wide tow box, plus (and I will spare you the details), I need insoles in even the comfiest of shoes.You'd think tennis shoes are a safe bet, but not so.I live in NYC, so I walk a lot... like a lot a lot... these are pretty much the only shoes I can guarantee won't hurt my feet after a couple of hours.Regarding sizing, I've worn a size 10 in all shoes since I was in high school - with these, I needed a 10.5.Stylish + comfy + well-priced = awesome"
"I was looking for a pair of white sneakers with a bit of a platform and black stripes to style some outfits.  The shoe fits true to size, but you should wear with socks the back of the shoe scrapes a bit and will eat any invisible socks.  This makes the styling with office or casual wear a bit tricky.  The sneaker has a low platform sole but it still looks flat.  You also walk flat-footed as one does with sneakers so there is no elongation of your legs as one would like with a platform or a more elegant shoe.  I know recent trends style elegant outfits with all types of sneakers, I think these will remain in the sport/athleisure side of my closet.  The sneakers have a padded insole but they require a bit of breaking in.  Topside is bright white leather."
"I am a pretty solid size 10 in nearly every shoe I have ever worn but my toes hit the end of these. These run a good half size too small and unfortunately when you wear a 10, they skip up to 11."
I really liked these shoes. Unfortunately they were too small. I normally wear a women’s 9 and these were just a bit too tight. I would need a 9.5 which they didn’t have so sadly I had to return not exchange. They seemed pretty comfortable when I put them on though.
super small cut very narrow and wide with is not offered as an optionNice looking well made with sturdy material.Eye candy
"I went 1/2 size up because these are German shoes. The nose is narrow, I need my feet to spread out in a show when I stand all day. These are very comfortable and reliable. Affordable."
"Nice Nice Sneaker, only issue is I should've went a size up but that's my fault but I love the feel and appearance of the shoe."
"La misura calza ottimamente, mi piace molto il tipo di sandalo a metá con una scarpa...impressioni ottime considerando il prezzo, le userò per cammini piu o meno lunghi in ogni situazione e terreno e vediamo come si comporta,se reggono."
"Un poco plásticas, gran ajuste pero calurosas en el pie. Bonitas y espero robustas y duraderas, más de entretiempo que de verano en mi caso. Buen precio.peimera experiencia con ellas"
"Ausgepackt, angezogen und vielfach erprobt. Guter bequemer Sitz, angenehm mit denen zu laufen."
"Me han gustado mucho,son cómodos estoy contenta por la compra"
Arrivato in tempo record ottimo prodotto comodo per camminare anche in montagna te lo consiglio.
Perfect!

Good quality cleats for the price. They also fit well. Bought as a gift for my friends son.
Look good and work well.  My 6 year old loves them
"I got these for my 7 year old to wear to his soccer league twice a week. He loves them! They work just as well as more expensive brands. He has a friend on his soccer team that has really expensive cleats (his mom said she paid $75 for them) and she cannot believe I paid so little for these!!! They do the same job as the expensive ones (if not even better) and my son said they are super comfy to wear. I am extremely happy and will continue to buy these in bigger sizes as my son grows. So far, he has been wearing them twice a week for 8 weeks and they are still in great condition. My son is super rough on shoes of any kind, but these are still looking great!!"
Perfect for little kid soccer. My son is 5 and this is his second pair (due to foot growing). I wouldn’t spend a lot on cleats for him not knowing if he will even stick with soccer and these have been great. It’s not like he’s playing for hours in the mud or anything so these do the job. Great price
"Wir haben Turnschläppchen für die Schule gesucht.Unsere Tochter trägt zZt Schuhgröße 30. Gemessen barfuss: 18,5 cmIch habe Größe 32 bestellt und wie erwartet sind sie etwas zu gross, aber nicht viel, sie sollten also im Sommer passen.Wenn ich die Schläppchen insgesamt mit dem Zollstock locker messe sind sie ca 20 cm lang.Gummisohle ist gut.Farbe/Muster schön.Preis ok.Verarbeitung gut, wie erwartet."
"my son LOVES these.  he's 5.  he says that they make him ""Super fast"".  They are PERFECT for your younger kid just trying out soccer.  I think they are decent quality and a great price.  I would probably buy something different for an older kid that was a more seasoned player.  Perfect for that kid who needs the cleats, but is just getting into the sport."
"Die Länge der Schläppchen ist passend zur angegebenen Schuhgröße, leider sind sie sehr schmal geschnitten und passen meiner Tochter, die schmale Füße hat nicht mehr sobald sie etwas dickere Socken an hat.Ansonsten sind die schläppchen aber super verarbeitet und sehen richtig toll aus!!!!"
These cleats are perfect for the beginning soccer player. Fit as expected/true to size. My son says that they’re very comfortable on his feet.
"Mein Kind trägt die Schläppchen jeden Tag im Kindergarten. Sie passen gut und sind bequem. Allerdings sind sie nach kurzer Zeit vorne durchgewetzt. Allerdings scheint es normal zu sein, dass bei allen Schläppchen nach spätestens 6 Wochen die Zehen rausschauen und diese ausgetauscht werden müssen."
"My grandson needed soccer shoes pronto and these fit the bill. They are easy for him to put on, comfortable, and he likes the black and silver style. The little soccer player is delighted with them. Grandma is satisfied they fit correctly. Everyone is happy with these...even the soccer coach."
Wir sind mit den Schuhen sehr zufrieden. Meine Tochter hat sich riesig darüber gefreut.Wir haben eine Schuhe eine Nummer größer gekauft also statt 26 eine 27. Diese passen super und durch die Sohle rutscht sie auch nicht.Über die Haltbarkeit kann ich noch nichts sagen.
"My 8 year-old was in a size 13 and these were too narrow and tight for him to wear for more than a few minutes. We do not usually have to buy wide shoes and his feet aren't very chubby. We got them on and he could walk/run in them, but he complained the entire time. They are very nice-looking shoes and appeared to be very good quality, but keep in mind they are very narrow.  I had to return them."
Wir haben diese Gymnastikschuhe für den Sportunterricht bestellt und kamen sehr schnell an. Die sind weich und die Farben waren genau wie auf der Abbildung. Unsere Tochter ist begeistert und empfindet die Schuhe als angenehm zu tragen. Die gekaufte Größe entspricht der tatsächlichen Größe.Preislich auch top. Ich würde sie bei Bedarf jederzeit wieder kaufen und weiter empfehlen
"They are obviously brand new, so I can't comment on durability at this time, but the initial quality looks good. They seem to fit my grandson well and after the first soccer practices he is happy with them."
"Diese super chicken Dinger, sind bei meiner kleinen Tochter Nea❤️, total eingeschlagen wie eine Bombe... Seitdem muss Ich Ihr nicht mehr den hinterher laufen den ganzen Tag lang, dass Sie sich entweder Socken oder ihre eigentlichen Schluffies anziehen soll... Ich bin froh darüber, dass Ich mich genau für dieses Modell entschieden habe, da Ich sonst niemals die Farbe blau wählen würde, ist für mich die hässlichste Farbe der Welt..!!! 👌🏼😁"
"1st pair I ordered for my son his size but didn't fit, so I ordered the next size up only to get 2 different sizes. 13 and 11 1/2.  I was very upset, I needed them for tomorrow.  Not happy, now i have to return those too ."
"Wir kaufen diese Marke nur noch. Sie sitzen einfach am besten. Man muss sich nur daran gewöhnen, bei Nutzung in der Kita, alle 1-2 Monate neue zu kaufen, da sie recht schnell abnutzen."
Habe die Schuhe für meine Tochter für den Kindergarten bestellt. Dafür sind sie auch super praktisch allerdings fallen die total klein aus. Werde die Schuhe jetzt nochmal 2 Nummern größer bestellen
"Leider recht unbefriedigend. Sie sind noch nicht ganz einen Monat im Einsatz und sehen schon so aus.Vorher hatten wir immer welche für rund 24 Euro/Paar von einer anderen Marke und sie wurden eher zu klein als dass sie kaputt gingen. Wer günstig kauft, kauft zwei mal.. Zudem finde ich das Bündchen relativ eng und steif, nur etwas für filigrane Füße und sehr dünne Socken."
"Schuhe passen Prima und gefallen meiner Tochter sehr gut. Gute anti rutsch Sohle! Würde ich so wieder kaufen, dank prime Wardrobe konnte meine Tochter sich ein paar Tage überlegen welche der bestellten schuhe ihr am besten gefallen."
"Después de 4 meses de haber comprado mis tenis se deterioraron exponencialmente. Se partió ""la piel"" y por la parte interior se enmohecieron. No volveré a comprar esa marca. Muy defraudada, quiero un rembolso"
I messed up and put these away for a special day and should have walked around in them sooner. I didn't know there was a return date so close to when I purchased them. I had an event to go to and decided it would be a good time to wear my new shoes. I had them on for approximately 15 minutes and it wore a sore in my back heal/ankle area. Luckily I brought another pair of shoes to wear. I am sure this problem will hurt anyone who tries to wear them. They are defective. My mistake. I will pay more attention to the return date next time.
"I have not worn my new Keds out yet but I am pleased to say these shoes fit me like a glove.  It is so unusual for this to happen to me so I am beyond thrilled!  My foot is long, medium in the toe area and narrow at the heel.  It has always been the hardest thing for me to find a shoe that fits, is cute and comfortable.  I saw these advertised several times more than likely on social media.  Every time I saw them I liked them more.  As a teenager I had worn Keds but really could not remember how they fit.  Finally I made the decision to order and I’m so happy with my purchase!"
Love these trendy and comfortable!
"Great fit, very comfortable, bright bold colors. High quality construction."
As expected
Very light
Parfait
"I don't understand people leaving bad reviews here, I just got them, put them on and went to play. There is NO CLICKING sound, if anything they are sticky to normal floors out of the box and the sole makes a sound as you walk, it obviously goes away on sidewalks or at the court and will not last. To those who complained about the toes being too tight or the ankle loose...learn to tie your shoelaces! They come with a normal cross lacing out of the box and yes, my right foot was too tight at the top, a slight pull and it was actually hurting on the side a bit, not on the other foot, but this is not how you tie your tennis shoes, on these I just went one across and then under the sides one up and across etc, the other lace straight up through the middle but there are a couple of aceptable ways, watch a video or something. The toe box is tight and slightly rigid at the top and sides, as it should be for a better feel and traction, it prevents your toes to hit the edge and hurt and the fit is perfect on its own, no need to get it tighter but  at the top of the lacing, however, the last eyelet is low, use it with the laces crossed and that will not allow your ankle to feel loose, but comfortable and secure without feeling the shoe. I had no problems at all lacing them right. No noises, they stick to the court like I have not felt before, they are light but you feel support and protection. Lots. It's amazing how quickly you take off in this when changing dictections. Tennis Warehouse gives these one of their best ratings on a pair of tennis shoes that I have seen. I don't know what so many here are talking about."
"From reading some of the prior reviews I had second thoughts but went for this shoe anyway.  I saw that it made top ten for tennis shoes 2018 and decided to try them for myself and I am not disappointed.There was no noise or weird sound from this sneaker as I walked.  It was perfect out of the box.  I also gotta say, based on a previous review, you must lace your shoes properly and those negative posts will not matter.  And looks!!! Plenty of complements as soon as I was in the public eye.  They are a great looking.Performance is great.  I feel secured and supported in this shoe.  Toes are wide and comfy, but fit perfect.  My favorite thing about buying online is that I have been wearing an Asics running shoe for about two years.  I bought them in a physical store and got the perfect fit (I've always went with New Balance or Nike in the past because of width).  Here I ordered the same size without trying on the Speed FF ever.  Same fit & function that made me chose the ASIC over the others the first time.  These are ASICS and they rock.The reason for 4 out of 5 stars is just based on price.  Amazon online shopping used to crush the stores on price, but this one was about the same.  The benefit was solely them coming to my door step, but I do recommend this court shoe."
"I use as a ""kick around"" shoe. I think I liked the looks of it the most.This tennis shoe is almost all rubber and lacks solid support for a tennis shoe. Like others have commented, it makes a strange annoying noise when I walk. It may be that it does not bend easily.With all the grooves, I thought it would breathe easily but it really does not breathe well!Also, with all the grooves on the toe area, it always looks dirty like there is a ton of dust in between all the grooves.Knowing what I now know, I would not buy this particular model again.However, I really like other Asics tennis shoes and will certainly consider them in the future."
"I always were Asics tennis size 11 and these were not only 1/2 size too small, but they were narrow and uncomfortable like a cheap Payless shoe. The heel slid around and I could not make the tight shoe even stay on my foot.I got a new size then wool socks since I like the design of the shoe but nothing worked. This is not asics. It did not feel like any of the dozens of asics shoes I ever bought.Asics is making great shoes and as soon as they make one, they discontinue the amazing product. Then they put out this garbage that is being discounted because it's a design flaw that they should take back from resellers.This experience frustrated me so much that I am heading out on a mission today to find a new brand of shoes that I can depend on that doesn't have lame colors I would never buy.Bye bye asics. It was a great time while it lasted."
"The Solution Speed FF is clearly a premium tennis sneaker. The weight is 12 OZ (very light) and you notice the speed difference it makes, you are just quicker. The shoe fits well over my low volume foot with just a slight amount of too much width for my C-D wide foot. I must carefully tighten the shoe strings to get a close enough fit. I did get a popping sound on the left show for a few months  but it has dissipated after breaking in. Do not just  overlook this shoe because of the negative comments about popping, it isn't that big a deal to me at least and it went away for me. If you want to be faster, this a shoe to consider and it is reasonably priced. The sole grabs effectively and the ventilation is supreme as I sweat a lot and no issues with this shoe unlike others I have tried, it really breathes nicely. It may not be the ideal shoe for wet surfaces as my Adidas are better on wet surfaces. Works great on indoor gym floors or outdoor dry surfaces that I have tried,"
"The toe area, arch and overall fit was what I expected (I have slightly wide feet and normally wear size 10.5, and I ordered 10.5).  Problem for me is the back of shoe -- the counter --  is a little too low.  This results in vertical movement of my heel when playing pickleball or tennis.  To compensate, I use the heel-lock lacing pattern,  but I have to pull the laces so tight it causes too much pressure on the top of my foot.  Will not buy this model again, nor do I recommend this model for pickleball or tennis.  Trying Gel Resolution 8 next...Dear ASICs,  what the h**l is going on?  Please bring back the Gel Resolution 7!  Stop tinkering, start improving."
"We have purchased New Balance nearly forever. Their quality has gone. We've been looking for an adequate replacement for a while now. If you have wider feet or pain issues, this may be your solution as well. Total quality. Great fit. So comfortable. Tried it with, and without orthotics. Works both ways. Could not be happier!"
Walking and Playing golf.  Very comfortable
They were a gift and he is very happy with them.
I need extra wide shoes that stabilize my knee. This did the trick where many others have failed. Thank you!
First pair worked great for me. Have high arches and needed a wide toe box.
Excellent shoe fits like a glove and very high quality against water
Absolutely the most comfortable shoes.
the shoes are comfortable on long walks.  I have problem where the back of the heal is wearing through the material used in that area
"Nel complesso buone, ma dopo solo quattro utilizzi la fodera della suoletta si sta già staccando. E' sottilissima e sarà impossibile incollarla, dovrò comprare delle suolette nuove."
"Para trabajar son muy buenas, no se mojan los pies, son de seguridad y no pesan q es lo importante también. Son muy bonitas y buenas estoy muy contento"
"buenas botas, se notan que son robustas y de buen material, son mas ligeras de lo que pensaba y eso se agradece ya que paso muchas horas con ellas  puestas ,por lo general muy contento.."
"Dopo un mese e mezzo, nonostante i vari tipi di ambiente,le scarpe reggono abbastanza bene, peccato per le fibie dei lacci che tendono a piegarsi"
"Für einen Arbeitsschuh gr. 43 etwas schwer am Fuß gegenüber anderen, aber sonst bin ich zufrieden, getest wird er noch"
Die Schuhe sind jetzt schon Defekt das kann ja wohl nicht sein.Wie kann das sein ?
"Für diesen Preis wirklich ein perfekter arbeitsschuh, durch meinen Beruf habe die Schuhe mindestens 10 Stunden am Tag an und bin nach wie vor echt begeistert! KlasseWürde ich immer wieder kaufen."
"Etwas zu schwer wie erwartet, Preisleistung sehr gut."
"Despues de 2 días intensos de trabajo las tengo que devolver, por que me hicieron daño en el tobillo y no me las puedo poner, se me inflamo el tobillo"
Für das Geld echt besser als man erwartet hätte.
"Purchased these sneakers on 4/25/20.  In five months, the treads are completely worn away.  Need a new pair.  Have liked RYKA shoes for a long time, but this is not acceptable."
Not comfortable at all no spring in the step. Memory foam insole was even hard. Sending them right back.
These are one of my favorite Ryka shoes.  They are so comfortable on my daily walks.  Can't say enough about Ryka and how they never have to be broken in.
"I’m very torn with this review.  The shoes are pretty comfortable but they wore out so fast.  I had them about a month and the bottom tread is completely gone already.  They did give me blisters at first but once I tightened them up that stopped.  I wanted to love them, but needed to replace them way faster than I anticipated."
"Unfortunately you can’t give zero stars! I ordered these shoes within two hours changed my mind and tried to cancel. I was told that I couldn’t because it was “already in processing.” I received the shoes and tried them on only to find they were uncomfortable, I no longer desired to keep them. I opted for a return only to be told I would have to pay for the return shipping and wasn’t guaranteed they would refund my money. Don’t get scammed by this company sneakers are not worth the hassle or supposed comfort!"
Love the bright colors of this shoe. Very light weight.  I didn't think the arch support was that great but I can wear them all day and had no foot pain. That is what I am looking for...cute and comfy for my feet!
"I love these Ryka shoes.  I purchased my usual 8 W; they fit well, are comfy and lightweight.  The colors, turquoise with lime trim, are so cute and fresh for summer wear.  Ryka is my fave brand."
Very nice 👍
Bought several pairs as wife is on her feet all day at work.  She loves them as they are comfortable and fit well.
great comfort on the concrete doing auto body/ mechanic and frame fork. but dont hold up bettrt than any others ive found
I bought these for my 70 year old mother who walks 5 miles 5 days a week. She says they are so perfect and give her the arch support she needs and that they don't rub on her toes. She's very happy with them.
"These hurt a lot, I could barely stand wearing them for 2 weeks. I ordered different boots already, waste of money."
These shoes are cheap and reflect their lower price. Not a lot of support under the ball of the foot and the memory foam in the sole is not very thick.  Not very supportive for a long walk but they work for jumping in and out of the car to go shopping.
"Bought a size 10 for my SNL, which is the size he wears.They were tighter than the previous style, so needed to exchange for next size.He loves these"
No satisfaction for a true 12.5D. 12 is too small and 13 too big. Everything I try in a 12 at Walmart fits perfectly. 4th time I just got the 13 and 3 different inserts to fill the void. Dissatisfied.
"The tongue of the shoe sticks out a bit, but otherwise is perfect. My sketcher steel toed boots fit a little better, but I have to go through a metal detector at work, so the composite toe shoes are better for that."
Uso siempre la marca Skechers me gusta para mí trabajo.

"Seit Jahren „Ecco“ ist meine Nummer 1 bei den Schuhen: sehr bequem, schön, hochwertig, Größe passt.Mit diesem Kauf habe ich eine neue Lieblingsschuhe bekommen."
"I normally wear 6.5 and these fit well without the need to remove their inserts. They are super comfy, make me feel like walking on cloud. The style is versatile, can dress up or down. Contemplating buying other colors"
Sehr bequeme Schuhe bin sehr zufrieden.
für mich viel zu eng.
"No complains what so ever, thank you!"
サイズはピッタリで履き心地さいこうで1日歩いても運動しても疲れません
These Ecco Flexure Runner Tie Sneakers are really comfortable. I have Plantar Fasciitis and they are the only shoes I found that I can wear.  I bought them in black and liked them so much I purchased them in Fig. I wear a size 10M and that's the size I bought.  They fit great.
"Love the color! Also, very comfortable and fits my between narrow and B width foot."
"Very cool! Lightweight, comfortable, true to size."
"I feel being deceived! The picture did not match with what was sent to us! Similar, but not the same!"
"Mega schöner, chicker und bequemer Sneaker. Der kleine glitzernde Details in rosé hat. Fällt nicht zu klein bzw. nicht zu groß aus. Kann ich nur empfehlen wer auf diesen aktuellen Style steht."
Cómodas y modernasA mi hija le encantaron.No son buenas para hacer deporte.
Me encanta 💖
Me han encantado las skechers voy super comoda con ellas
Comfortableness and light weight
Leider fällt der Schuh sehr klein aus. habe normal 43 und brauchte jetzt 44 da er extrem eng ist. 44 ist grenzwertig wird sich aber einlaufen.Design ist der Oberhammer. Preislich nicht zu toppen.
"Fällt klein aus, hab sonst 42,5, hier passt 43 gerade so. Sieht gut aus und sitzt bequem, hab eher hohen Rist, kein Problem bei dem Schuh. Sohle sammelt aber jedes Katzenhaar, nicht als Hausschuh geeignet also. Preislich ein Schnäppchen."
"der Schuh sieht wirklich sehr schön aus, allerdings passte er mir leider nicht richtig und ich musste ihn zurück schicken. Er ist aus Leder gefertigt und nicht aus synthetischem Material."
Fits slightly smaller then expected. Great shoe but I wish I ordered half a size or a size larger.
"Co respecto al precio excelente, mi pie es un poco ancho sin embargo la horma es pequeña hay que pedir medio número más para que quede bien del empeine"
Los tenis me encantaron quería unos desde hace bastante pero vienen demasiado ajustados del empeine y tuve que regresarlos
"Hab sie in Gr. 44 unter 37€ bekommen. Sehen super aus und die Qualität ist gut, sind ja Markenschuhe."
ME GUSTO TODO
I own two pairs of this shoes. They are the most comfortable shoes. It is true to size. I highly recommend it.
Muy buen producto
good deal! Only 20 dollars! Better than expected!

"Bellissimi stivaletti rosa,con pelliccia sia interna che esterna,caldi e adatti per la pioggia, davvero carini"
"Se sienten bien, muy comodos, no es la mejor calidad pero esperemos ver cuanto nos duran."
"At first glance and use, I really liked these base shoes. However, now that they are getting broken in some I am starting to have problems with them. First of all, the standard insole that comes in these is almost paper-thin. After 1 day of working 4 travel games, my feet were exhausted. Then I added a standard aftermarket insole to help the second day and the back seam rubbed a large blister on one of my heels. I will continue to use them but will do so with boot socks on and not average referee socks from Smittys or Cliff Keen. The fit overall is a tad bit small but still wearable."
"I bought these in my normal size and was unable to fit them on my feet. I own several pairs of New Balance and they are all 11.5, some extra wide and one in extra extra wide. They were obviously shorter than my other shoes when positioning sole against sole. I cannot review anything but this aspect about them, since I couldn't wear them. I took advantage of Amazon's return policy and exchanged them for a half size larger in the regular cut 950 V3 because the mid cut style was unavailable at that time. The replacement shoes fit just fine. I guess New Balance isn't consistent in its sizing across styles."
im in Law Enforcement  there are great for long standing details !!!!
I was hoping that even with a wide-width this would fit okay and I wasn't disappointed. I love New Balance shoes and -with a size 14 foot - it's never as easy as going to the store for what I need. These shoes are comfy and the extra high sneaker top gives me a little more support than daily runners.
Amazon you did it again! Great shoes for the best price on the Internet! These ones do not have the MLB logo on the back . So if you want that don’t get these ones but I don’t care about that!
I bought a size bigger as other reviewers advised to do. Glad I did as the size I bought (men’s 12) were perfect. I used them during the 2021 youth baseball season and they were the most comfortable pair of umpiring shoes I’ve ever worn. I bought a 2nd pair just to put on the shelf for future use.
Item delivered as expected.....on time but when opened one of the shoe laces was torn and not of use for the right shoe ....I would expect that the product was inspected before shipment ....I should not have to return or go out and replace shoe lace.
"These shoes will make you feet hot like they are being cooked, not a good shoe to wear out in the sun, in the South. Neither are they made to do a lot of walking around in."
"Great shoe, comfort, fits great, compared with other field shoes, New Balance, out does them all. Great price!"
Bought these for my son for highscool baseball  .... working good.... now i just have to get him to take them off before he comes in the house...metal cleats are rough on the floors
Previously worn Nike and New Balance cleats and they wore out before the season was over and these cleats are noticeably lighter and lasted the entire season just fine.
Decent quality but nearly impossible to put on.
"My daughter uses these cleats and they actually stay white, unlike the rest of the white cleats on the market.  They are easy to clean too.Comfortable and true to size."
They were great
I would like to change the product because it is very small
Per mare o piscina ideali senza spendere molto. Comodo e residenti ideali per i ragazzi e non solo
Scarpe molto molto belle comode ebelle calde poi nere vanno su tutto vi consiglio di prendere il vostro numero io ho il 39 ho preso il 39 1/2 e mi stanno leggermente larghe
"Wir haben die Schuhe in der Farbe schwarz bestellt. In der Rechnung und auf dem Schuhkarton stand auch schwarz als Farbe, doch uns wurden die Schuhe in dunkel blau geliefert. Punktabzug gilt der falschen Lieferung.Wir haben die Schuhe in blau trotzdem behalten. Die Farbe ist sehr schön und die Schuhe sind wie erwartet sehr bequem."
Sehr bequem und robust!

Order a size down or half a size down. Feel great and look fab!
Immer wieder!
Passt und gefällt sehr gut!

Passen und gefallen sehr gut!
I have converse in almost every color and shape. I had never seen these before. I was intrigued for sure. I had to get them! They are very thick and soft on the inside. The outside sole is a bit chunky. The outside is a nice suede. Nice for the winter. They were on sale for 39$ I believe. Normally 100 if I'm not mistaken. I would not pay 100. 39 I consider a win though.
Der Schuh sitzt und sieht sehr gut aus
"Empfenlenswet,toller preis,grösse passt genauToller schuh und schön verarbeitet,top"
Super
Ein toller gemütlicher Schuh ...passt in Gr 38 sehr gut...würde ich wieder kaufen ..tolle Optik 👍

J'adore la marque : produit de qualité
Top Qualität. Sitzt wie angegossen. Sehen hervorragend aus👍🏽
"Ich habe schon viele UA Turnschuhe, habe mir ""meine"" typische Größe bestellt, aber die hier sind so extrem klein und vor allem schmal, das ging gar nicht... Ging Retoure, leider nur per dpd möglich, dazu muss ich allerdings knapp 10km fahren, auf mein Geld warte ich noch, ist aber auch erst 3 Tage her und nicht über Amazon, sondern das Sportgeschäft."
Muss man 1 Nummer größer bestellenSind so bequem wie HausschuheHabe jetzt schon 2 Paar und werde mir noch ein 3. bestellenSehr zu empfehlen
"This gray black shoe as pictured and ordered is not what it appears.  It arrived and actually has a navy blueish tint to it.  Not what I expected from the pictures when ordering.  I have good eye vision, but maybe I need my eyes checked again ha.  It is however a great looking design."
Its a beautifully made shoe but way too small! It feels like 1.5-2 sizes too small.
Had to return it. Definitely buy a whole size bigger. Super tight.
"Zu klein, leider. Farbe und Material ist toll."
So I did read a bunch of reviews before I bought these so I ordered a size 7 and normal wear a 6.5 or 7 depending on the brand. I have really narrow feet so I went with the larger size that I normally wear with some brands. I will say when I first put them on I thought they might not work but the fabric of the shoes does loosen up a bit after you start wearing them. You have narrow and thin feet I suggest going up only a half a size unless you like looser fitting shoes.Moving in to the actual shoe. Absolutely beautiful true to color in the pictures. Extremely light weight. Very comfortable. Worth every penny.I am a caregiver for the elderly so I am in my feet a lot and I can tell you I have not gone home once with my feet hurting after wearing these shoes for sometimes longer than 24 hours straight. I am not at all disappointed in the purchase and I have received tons of compliments on them.
Extremely good shoe. Very comfy. Only thing I noticed is the show opening is a little tight. Once you break it in it’s not hard to get in but the first couple times are tight. Very very nice otherwise! Wear good when active and busy as well
"I was excited to get this product in the mail.I had not bought new shoes for myself in 3 yrs.I opened the package took out the shoe, it was a very nice shoe. Went to put it on and could not get my foot into the shoe,it was to narrow in the back.i wear a size 6 shoe this was very upsetting for me .I will not buy shoes online ever again."
"Icy cool shoes, top quality but pay a close attention to the size. I have 8,5, ordered 8,5 and it turned out to be too small, For Under Armour you need to plan 1 size bigger."
"Excelente calzado. Muy buena amortiguación y excelente durabilidad. El nuevo compuesto Enerzy de la entresuela que incluye Mizuno es más estable y a mi parecer, más duradera. Un calzado apropiado para sumar kilómetros a ritmos lentos que sin duda alguna te darán al menos 900 km de excelente amortiguación y muy buen agarre por la suela que es muy reconocida por su durabilidad. Quizá me hubiera gustado más en un color negro uniforme o con un diseño más similar a la versión anterior. Ampliamente recomendable."
"Amortiguamiento insuperable... ideales para correr en concreto. Gran producto. Hasta más agujetas son increíbles, jamás se aflojan 🤣"
Excelente calidad. Lo recomiendo ampliamente muy cómodos.
Exactly what I expected.  And price was right too.  Almost too good to be true…
Muy bueno exelente mizuno muy cómodos a buen precio
"fit perfectly nice, good stability and support"
"So first things, I'm not a runner, I'm a walker though.  I bought these during the prime day sale in the gray and blue color way.  These are incredibly comfortable and very cushioned.  I've been wanting to try Mizuno shoes anyway after owning brooks for a while.  The knit uppers are a bit thick so they aren't going to wear out soon, but conform well after walking in the shoes for a bit.  The half-bootie that wraps the sides of the foot and holds the tongue secure is very comfortable and unnoticeable even with thin socks.  The inside of the shoe at the toe is seamless thanks to the knit uppers and very comfortable and very foot hugging.  The heel area hugs well and keeps it from moving at all which is nice.  Overall the fit is very secure and the ride is very plush.  They do not have and stability control though so if you're an under or over pronator these shoes may not be for you.They are definitely true to size.  I ordered these in an 11R (which is also my size in brooks) and they fit spot on.  If you're looking for a very comfortable, plush, well built shoe, these are certainly a best buy."
"I ended up being recommended these by a local running store based on my running needs at the time. When I started a new job in a concrete warehouse, I ended up falling back to these shoes for walking throughout the building. 10-15 miles of walking per day and these shoes hold up great. I ended up getting a second new pair direct through Amazon to replace my falling apart pair. I would say that for walking, you can easily get 600+ miles out of these shoes. They are comfortable, they support your feet, and even when you're a bigger guy like me they don't cause me to have aches and pains I find in other shoes."
"I noticed that my Brooks running shoes were wearing out faster than previously.  Consequently, I began trying out other brands.  One of those brands was Mizuno.  I purchased the men's Wave Sky 4 Waveknit and have been vary happy the the cushioning and the ware characteristics of these shoes.  I purchased shoes made by Mizuno years ago and I don't remember why I did not continue with this brand.  However the Wave Sky 4 is a winner.  I purchased additional pairs one week after running in them."
"I had purchased the previous version of this show and found it an excellent shoe for walking/hiking as well as running. the flexibility in the midsole makes it good as a walking shoe. The cushioning is better this time too, and the outsole looks at tough as the previous version. The last pair (wave runner 3) had gone almost 700 miles of city walking wear and tear before being replaced. This shoe has minor improvements in the weight of the shoe, and the design of the tongue, collar and counter lining make for a better fit. The lace lock is a little high in my opinion, but hasn't been an issue so far."
"Me mandaron diferentes estampados.El izquierdo tiene letras más grandes y logo no centrado vs el derecho.Cómodas si, pero se nota que son de diferentes lotes y así los guardaron sin fijarse en el estampado del logo y el centrado del mismo."
"I'm usually in between sizes (8.5 and 9) and often order the larger size when shopping online. I did (9), but it is still too small, I would have had to go another half-size up than everything I've ever worn - 9.5 which I've never worn before. I highly recommend ordering a size up than what you usually wear. It's too much effort to do an exchange for something of this value but whatever I'll stick with it even though it's quite small."
"Ya había tenido experiencia con las sandalias de Puma, así que decidí adquirir este modelo y la verdad que estoy encantado con la calidad del material y de la comodidad que ofrece, no hubo problemas con las medidas, y el tiempo de entrega fue antes de lo previsto, un 10/10."
Yo generalmente uso talla 26.5 MX. No podía pedir 6 porque me quedarían pequeñas. Así que iba a pedir 7. Pero leí comentarios que era mejor pedir una talla más grande. Las pedi del 8 y aún así se sienten muy justas. Tal vez les falta más uso. Pero una talla 9 hubiera sido perfecta.
"Ya había comprado varios productos en amazon y había quedado satisfecho hasta estás sandalias, llegaron la fecha indicada la talla y el color correcto, solo un detalle, que las sandalias se ven usadas llegaron con la suela sucia se ve como usadas y sin etiquetas...estoy muy molesto no pueden vender productos usados como nuevos..."
"La caja llego demasiado dañada pero las sandalias venían muy bien empacadas, por lo que no se dañaron. Son un poco duras pero cómodas; el precio es bastante bueno vs la calidad del producto"
Muy cómodas. Sí tienes que pedirlas un número mas grande al tuyo. Me gustaron mucho y el precio se me hizo algo elevado pero vale la pena.
"El diseño esta regular, vienen angostas en lo ancho y en lo largo, a diferencia de otros modelos que eh tenido y por lo mismo si tienes el pie ancho como yo, se despegaran rapido, por el precio creo que estan bien"
Son un poco más pequeñas que la talla habitual a mi hijo le quedaron justas
"Le quedaron super bien, comodas y a la medida"
"These are the worst cleats I have ever had. They are very stiff and I have blisters all over my feet. I've played soccer since I was a child and these just wrecked my feet. I got them because they are made for wide feet, which they do well on that part, but they are just super uncomfortable and too stiff to even try to break them in. I've worn them almost 8 times and each time my feet blister, bleed, toe-nails break etc."
"Excellent quality, nice form fit to the width and heel of the foot. Good toe room, comfortable. Does run small in length."
cleats are somewhat deep; will try to return back to amzn
Great medium quality boot. Is a little narrow in the toe box.
"Fits perfectly but I’ve lost three studs already even though I’ve tightened them up. However, I bought some adidas replacement studs because I could find any oasis ones."
Fast Delivery and Good quality. Size runs as expected.
Asics makes a great soccer shoe.  It has an elevated heel and gel support.  This has meant no more heel problems for us.
good quality
I just used them the other day and they are by far the best fitting pair of soccer shoes that I have ever owned.
"Haben leider nicht lange gehalten, reißen an den Seiten ein und der Kleber lößt sich auch von der Sohle.."
Alles in Ordnung
Love the shoe but sizing is off. I wear an 8.5 and there is no way I can wear the 8-8.5. BUT I love the shoe so I’m getting the next size up.
These are beautiful shoes! The genuine leather looks and smells great. Love them but they do run small.
"Powderbug are ours ""to go"" boots for Manitoba winters, but the fit is really small. My kid wear size 1-2 youth this year, I ordered size 4  and they were tight, so I returned and ordered size 5. Those boots are very warm and good quality, but they are definitely on narrowed and smaller side when talk about sizing.  If you order online, go to the store and try them on to be sure in size."
"Belles bottes robustes et arrivées à temps.  Malheureusement, beaucoup trop étroite pour les pied de mon fils.  J’ai retourné l’article et fut remboursé très rapidement."
The fit was perfect and the boots are so warm! My daughter finds them easy to run and play in and they are completely waterproof. Would definitely buy again!Shipping was very fast.
Bonnes bottes chaudes et imperméables pour mon fils de 8 ans
"I wish I had read the other reviews and seen that these boots run small.  We will probably only get half of the winter out of them.  I wanted to invest in Columbia since my child's school switched to an Outdoor Classroom this year because of COVID.  But these seem like beyond warm?  They are rated to -45 F / -43 C.  I am sure that snow boots don't need to be that warm.  I would never send my child out to play if it was -45 Fahrenheit!Because of the extra thick padding on the sides, these boots are extremely hard to get on.  My child had to shove and shove and shove his foot and hold onto my shoulders and shove some more.  And then repeat again with the other foot.  I have four children and have encountered my share of snowboots; these are harder to get on than is customary.  I can't imagine being the classroom teacher that had to help a whole room of children with these boots!My son is excited about them, and they will be warm, but unless they prove to be outstanding feature-wise or durability-wise, I don't plan to get them again.  I'll look for something that is easier for him to get on independently."
"My kids love these boots. Their first pair they were so much they were through the soul to the point where there was holes, and their feet were getting wet. They also didn’t bother to tell me that the old pair were hurting their feet because their toes were at the end. So I thought purchasing the next size up would fix the problem. But now their feet actually grew an extra size past that. Returns were nice and easy. Unfortunately I needed boots right away and could not wait for a second pair to get shipped. The only available ones that would fit them locally were Sorell’s, and my wallet felt that pinch."
"Super warm, durable boots with good fit!"
Cute boots but they run really small.
I loved them
Looked great but first time wearing shoe lace started coming apart.. meant to return for replacement but buy the time I remembered past the 30 days looks great but not as durable as I would hope ..
Super cute and comfy for our little guy.
"Shoe was very tight on my son, could only fit him for a couple weeks"
"No me gustan para nada. Yo he tenido de está marca y siempre las he llevado cómodas pero estas son increíblemente incómodas. Muy tiesas , la parte de atrás se hace para delante y roza en todos los sitios. Siempre he usado un 38 y estos aprietan. Y llevo años confiando en está marca y la plantilla resbala muy difícil andar con ellos, tiesos tiesos realmente. No lo recomiendo para nada"
"Extraordinarias zapatillas, super comodas, se adaptan al pie, no pesan, calidad panama jack. Estoy encantada."
"Stylischer Schuh, Empfehlung👍"
Me quedan perfectas
Mas cómodas imposible
"the strap is too tight across my high arch.  however, since the fit is so perfect the strap is not needed.  I would buy repeatedly."
Way too big
Quality is excellent.
"Los compré para la comunión de mi hija, a simple vista son muy bonitos, pero la calidad es pésima, un solo día y la suela pelada"
Muy cómodas y más bonitas que en la foto
Las he comprado para la comunión de mi hija y son más bonitas que en la imagen.
Lucky Brand Men's Sarey Ankle BootMiss id’ed these are woman’s bootI knew going in that this style is a women’s which I chose to get themFor the price the quality is just not thereNicks in one heelGlue around sole edgeJagged edges between sole and upper near heelAs part of the boot design the tips and back low heel area are a shinier compared to the matte look of the rest of the bootTrue to sizeFull zip on each boot to make easier to place onI have thicker calves and I was able to place on and zip up fullyTop of the tips of the boots rub against toes but only in certain areas I can already tell that if I don’t wear thicker socks it is going to cause blisters and quicklyAll in all between the quality issues and weird rubbing I am disappointed in these
"I’m an 8 1/2 normal width and often have to size up on boots especially with this brand. These are a perfect fit. I even tried them with thick socks and they were great.They’re well made, great for skinny pants and wide enough to wear with a slim fit pair of trousers and would look good with a skirt or dress.I did a longish walk in them and they’re great. No pinching and didn’t feel at all narrow. The sole is flat so not ideal for winter with ice and snow but good for wet weather."
These are nice for going out.  The fit is fine. They feel very solid and well made. They seem durable.  We have other products from this company and have been happy with them.The fit was good. They seemed to be high quality. They went on and off easily.They have a bit of a heel but it’s not too hard to walk in.
"Lucky Brand never disappoints. Their shoes/boots always run TTS. This pair of boots is very comfortable, especially with the lower heel. The stitching is tight and the outer shoes is a good quality leather. You won’t be disappointed."
"C'est vrai, ce sont des chaussures de running compétition. Mais je les utilise seulement pour marcher. Elles sont certes confortables, car elles sont assez larges et je n'ai pas de points de frottement. Cependant, je les trouve un peu dures et j'ai mal aux jambes, quand je marche d'un bon pas pendant 2 heures. Je chausse 38 et j'ai pris 39.J'aime bien les coloris de ce modèle."
"Demasiado duras y con poca sujeción. Son ligeras y cómodas, eso si."
Toller Sportschuh. Passt wie angegossen.
Love my new balance. Wear for running and work
Todo perfecto!! Eran para mi novia y esta encantada!!!
Super Schuh
Me han encantado! Más en físico que no n foto
Son unas zapatillas muy cómodas para entrenar además de ligeras.
"Awesome shoe but I wear a 7 in street shoes so usually wear a 7.5 in running shoes. These fit like a 7, just barely get feet in so I'd require an 8 for the first time.  Side by side against my 880V7 they're significantly smaller - both size 7.5.  If you usually wear a size 7 neutral running shoe BUY THESE.  Very well made and get great reviews!3/22/20 Followup - finally got my hands on a size 8, 1/2 size larger than I've ever worn. They are AWESOME. No break-in period, no weird pressure points, a true neutral shoe & super comfortable."
"I have an issue with my toenails rubbing on the inside of the toe of the shoe. It's not a sizing problem, it's the way my feet fit into shoes. I have my nails trimmed back as far as I can, but if I walk too long in them I lose toenails. Other than my issue, I really like these shoes! The wind does blow right through them, so you may need thicker socks if your feet get cold easily."
Extremely comfortable and affordable!
"Ottimo sandalo, di buona qualità costruttiva, molto comodo. Le fasce incrociate sono in pelle che nonostante sia nuova non è eccessivamente dura, la suola è ergonomica e abbastanza,a spessa, composta da vari tipi di materiale, dalla gomma inferiore all'intersuola in un materiale che sembra sughero. Il tutto da come risultato una calzata confortevole il piede non è costretto anche se ben inserito nel sandalo. Io calzo il 41 e per questo modello non esiste quindi ho ordinato il 41,5 e mi va benissimo quindi nel dubbio il mezzo numero in più va bene. Per il prezzo pagato circa 55 € sono un ottimo acquisto."
"Las sandalias están bien. Es buen material, aunque la suela es algo dura.El problema está en el daño que producen en los pies. El acabado del cuero en sus bordes desgarra la piel de pies y dedos, lo cual va a hacer imposible que se calcen durante las semanas que la piel tarda en curar y crear durezas y defensas naturales.Se pueden poner tiritas y demás, pero duele igualmente.No soy de pies delicados: cada verano únicamente calzo sandalias de piel.Estas además no me quedan ni grandes ni pequeñas. Tallaje perfecto.Es el tipo de calzado que precisa ser usado muchas veces hasta que por fin se adapta y se reblandece.Por este motivo no se le pueden dar más estrellas: deberían de haber cuidado más el acabado de los bordes."
"Viste ad un amico, provate e comprate subito. Ottima calzata e comodità elevata per l'estate. Non ci ho mai fatto km però quindi per le lunghe distanze non so se va bene. Comunque ottimo prodotto."
Bisogna prendere un numero in più. Pellame di qualità e manifattura eccellente. Sicuramente dopo averli indossati qualche giorno dovrebbero diventare molto comodi.
Die Sandale ist sehr hochwertig und bequem sollte jedoch eine Nummer größer bestellt werden.
"Bellissime e comodissime ciabatte Timberland, non potrei chiedere di più."
Excelente calidad y muy comodas
Calza  molto stretto e  piccolo servono 2 numeri in più
Scomode per portarle più di 2 ore e camminare
"sono ottime ciabattine per il mare, molto comode ed eleganti, da usare anche la sera con un pantalone lungo di lino bianco."
"Me equivoqué de número, pero los tenis estaban súper bonitos, buena calidad y el color divino. Suelo comprar trnis de niña porque calzo muy pequeño, pero esta vez me equivoqué de número. Big kid, little kid, son medidas confusas para mi. Los pedí Little kid #3 y el resultado es un número #21 Mexicano de adulto. Yo soy #22 así que no me quedaron."
"Quedaron como esperaba,  la talla bien bien de acuerdo a lo especificado, a mi hijo le parecieron muy cómodos y le encantan por que tienen agujetas pero no se las tiene que amarrar"
El calzado nos gustos mucho
"My son really loves these shoes. They have permanently attached elastics instead of true laces. This does make them a bit more snug and they need a few wears to break in. They seem to run a tad bit small, so I would order a size up if I purchased again. I went by the size chart and ordered the half size bigger than the chart indicated, and while they fit, they are a bit snug and he could have used a slightly larger size."
"They are sooo adorable, my daughter gasped when she saw them. Unfortunately, they seem to run just a little too small, she could not fit her foot in it and he laces don't come off, it's a slip on shoe. She's wearing a size 1 right now in a diff brand and when I compared them they are about the same size with the DC shoe being just a tad small. Also. my daughter's foot is a little on the thick side. It seems to be very well made and I will be giving them as a gift."
The 1st shoes that arrived my son couldn't even get on his feet! As they are basically slip on sneakers. I got an exchange no problems & sized up. They fit now and they will give slightly over time so your foot goes in better but not so much that they go out of shape. I’ve even had them in the washing machine to clean them and they came out great!! I just leave them to air dry for a few days
"Perfect for your kid if he doesn't like shoelaces. My nine yo has no patience for shoe tying, so these are perfect as they slip right on. I don't think we'll get more than 6-7 months out of them, but at this price point I don't mind repurchasing in that timeframe. It is so worth it to not be late every time I have to wait for my son to get his shoes on and get in the car."
"The shoe's length was a proper size, but it rubbed on the top part of his foot in two spots. He never wears a wide, but this shoe needed to be offered in a wide for it to fit comfortably."
My son absolutely loves these shoes. And with the elastic laces he doesn't have to stress about them coming untied. For a high functioning spectrum kid with social anxiety that is amazing!
"I have a pair in black so my daughter wanted sneakers like daddy. So loves them, best of all they don’t need to be tied they slip on. No loose laces"
The shoes themself are very good in all aspects but it took the seller 10 days just to ship. Delivery date in my account was changed 4 times! This is no good. If product is sold it must be available. No word about backorder as well.
Perfect for my 13 year old concert band performances
These hurt my son's fit and he couldnt wait to get out.
"Great quality, attractive design, comfortable and nicely packaged!! Oh and did i mention GREAT PRICE!!!"
Perfect quality
"Great, high-quality shoe!"
Nice looking dress shoe. Fit about a half size smaller than expected.
I ordered a lace up shoe and received a slip on!  Cannot return because event is 2 days away.
Perfect fit.
Excellent
"Aufgrund der positiven Resonanz habe ich mir diesen Schuh bestellt.Voller Vorfreude öffnete ich das Paket und musste feststellen, dass der Kleber nicht richtig verarbeitet wurde (Siehe Bilder).Sehr ärgerlich!Offensichtlich B-Ware... wenn überhaupt!!Versand was zügig und unproblematisch."
Sehr schmal und das Leder ist mir zu hart .
They are well made but they are heavy and uncomfortable...
"Sneaker passen prima, gute Qualität, guter Preis"
Il prodotto è ottimo confortevole e maneggevole.
Birkenstock é una garanzia!
"I don't do reviews so much anymore, but these shoes were a nice surprise. Fit was just exactly right, and so comfy!"
The cushioning is sublime. The fit is perfect - no heel slippage. Laces are a bit stiff. The heel counter is stiff.I recently tried the ultraboost 20. Those hurt my arch. These have a lower arch support so no pain with these.
I received fake adidas from Shoebacca. I recommend buying directly from Adidas.
"Comfortable shoes, nice color."
Super comfy
Very confortable and suitable for running
"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I just love my shoes 🥰"
These run big... Order half size smaller
These dame just as expected beautiful show for the price!
Son bastante cómodos y livianos
"I made the purchase for the color. It arrived just as i expected.  What i dint expect was the comfort.  The style is like a sock kinda feel.  So, your foot is snuggled and fit inside.  But the sole of the shoe is super comfy.  It has this added support on the heal and its a pleasure to walk in."
"I bought these because I started a job where I'm on my feet walking on concrete floors all day. They are very comfortable! They do run a bit wide, and I have more narrow feet. The heel is extremely cushioned, which is great, but because the shoes are a bit wide for me, my foot tends to slide off of the cushioning and go forward in the shoe. So I'm probably not getting all the benefit of the extremely cushioned heel. The other thing is, the tongue of the shoe tends to migrate toward the outside of the shoe, which isn't the end of the world, it just looks weird, so I'm forever re-adjusting it. But again, this could be because my foot has some room to slide around in the shoe.I'd definitely recommend this shoe to someone with a wider foot. They are very comfortable and look fine with dark pants, if you're in an environment where you have to wear slacks."
"Reebok sneakers fit me better than any other. Most importantly, they fit me true to size. I made the mistake of buying another pair in size 11, the shoe size I usually wear, but I'm so glad that Reebok has half sizes. The 10.5 fit me much better. In addition, these shoes are made specifically for walking and they're so comfortable for that purpose. Better than ""casual"" shoes and better than ""training"" shoes."
"I love wearing these! I have a wide foot but the regular width, half size up, worked for me. I have been looking for a shoe that felt like a dream and these were perfect for me!"
"This was purchased for my 73 yo mom. She loved a similar previous model with the rounded bottom sole to help with her foot issues. These were good, but I should have purchased the other styles that came in wide."
It just did not fit my feet right as I have a high arch and I needed better support. Wish some1 would create walking shoes that have great arch and midsole support at the same time... maybe someday Reeboks would. Thanks.
"I bought this based on the recommendations. They run small, and do not stretch out much. I like running, but also need a pair for working in a warehouse, which I'm always on my feet. Very Disappointed.I'm usually a 9, but too small, and then 9.5, still uncomfortable and tight. Now I have to return them and pay for shipping."
"Typical great Reebok quality, but fits a little snug.  You may want to order a 1/2 size larger for a more comforty fit."
"We buy Reebok because of the quality and price, and this is another shoe that doesn't disappoint.  great product and great look."
Quality - Good. Leather and suade are of good quality BUT the dye on the suade comes off during cleaning if using a wet cloth/brush (I have the black) when cleaning the white sole.Comfort - Good. Not running or walking shoe comfort and they are bulky and on the heavy side BUT they are good for casual purposes. The insole is great!!Fit - Order your normal size. Very slightly large but NOT enough to order a half size down.Value - Great if you can pick these up for under $60.
Nice casual shoe
"Fatal , hace muchísimo en la parte de atrás de la pierna , para el precio que tiene y el daño que hace no merece nada la pena."
These shoes are awesome so far. I have Morton's neuroma in my foot so I'm always looking for a shoe with a wider toe box and cushion. I have played with these twice on hard court and I have had no toe jam and there is plenty of cushion. I tried the B width as well but those were a little too snug. The wide which felt really roomy but in the end worked great on court. There is no break in period. I am a 5.0 player and i'm rough on my shoes so we will see how well these hold up.
"I was so excited to received these because they looked so cool and flashy but immediately after I tried them on, they were super uncomfortable. The crease just above the top of the laces cut into my toes when I would bend my feet to take a step. I was surprised because the reviews claimed to be comfortable and did not need any breaking in. I must have got a bad pair. I returned them for a different brand entirely."
I bought these to replace my last pair of court shoes for pickleball.  This time around I'm spending more because these are to be good for my planter fasciitis.  They feel comfortable just walking around the house!  Can't wait to use them on the courts in the morning!  They may be worth the extra $$.(I can live with just about any color if they fit right :) )
I play tennis and this shoe is easy on my bunion and the knit material gives. I can play without any bunion pain. it is a wider shoe I ordered a 9B and it was perfect.
"I first tried a pair of 8.5 wide in the Guava/black through the prime wardrobe.  They were too big.  I normally wear 8 wide but my arches have started to drop,  getting flat footed so I’ve been trying a half size larger.  I sent them back and tried the black/lime in 8 wide.  I couldn’t get my foot into the shoe!  They were very tight.  I sent them back and ordered the guava/black in 8.5 wide again.  I loved the color.  Just a little out there for an old lady but I like them.  The second pair fits great!  There are differences in where the shoes are made and who made  them and what day it is.  It’s a crap shoot.  I do recommend this shoe.  They are so comfortable on old feet.  I love the guava color.  I’ve gotten complements on them."
"This would be a great shoe, unless you have high arches. There is NO arch support and they are sooo flat. They are light, and breathable and great in every other way. But even with arch supports i had to send these back. Definitely more cushion in heel and leaves arches and front foot feeling beat up."
"The back material and the front material inside the shoe isn't sewn together. It looks like to me it should be. A plastic like material is showing. BN won't answer phone. Sent text and pics their website site said to do , no response. I guess I need to send back. Can't find out if it is a defect. Poor workmanship even if it is suppose to be like this. I got the extra wide 10.5 and it still feels a little tight. The shoe strings are too short. I had another pair of NB shoes in pass that the string whee too short. I have to take the strings out of some of the whole to be able to have them loose enough to tie. That pair was from 5-10 years ago. Thought they would know by now to make their strings longer. I have a high arch, I don't know if that is the reason I need more string length, but this is the only manufacturer that I have run into this problem. If I but a pair of the mens I don't have that problem, just some of their women tennis shoes. I can't keep waiting for them to respond to tell me if this is a defect to send them back.  Does anyone else that bought this show have the material inside the shoe look like this? where the front material and the back material in the inside isn't sewn together? Please someone let me know, since I can't get a response from NB."
but the fit is perfect.  Will definitely order this again.  I was wearing Asics and the toe box on the Asics were so tight that I had horrible blisters.  Switched to New Balance and won't go back.  The color is BRIGHT pink - but I am gettin used to it.
"I sometimes take a 6 medium width, sometimes a 6 wide, depending on the shoe.  I've had New Balance before and no issues.  However this court shoe in a size 6 was ridiculously narrow, I couldn't even get my foot into the shoe with the laces wide open.  Sending back."
Love the comfort of these shoes. Nice to actually feel comfortable in a pair of court shoes.
"Adquirí este producto el  30 diciembre 2020.  Botas impermeables, que utilizo para la caza con  tiempo lluvioso.  La temporada pasada las usé el mes de enero y esta temporada el mes de noviembre, solo sábados y domingos, por lo tanto muy poco usadas, ya que con tiempo seco utilizo bota de  cuero.  No es normal que un producto de esta marca y este elevado  precio, Botas de gama alta y marca fiable, eso es lo que pensaba hasta ahora, haya tenido este defecto, se ha soltado toda la costura.Espero tener una respuesta del vendedor de este producto.Saludos."
The outer shell is waterproof except for the tongue. What a dumb decision. Any snow gets on the laces and the heat from the foot melts it through and freezes your foot.
It didn’t have the specs on the sole as advertised. Still a great boot.
"J'ai commandé un point plus grand et elles sont parfaites. Très légères et confortables. Surtout, elles sont chaudes et gardent bien les pieds au sec. Elles ne sont pas glissantes."
Pas très chaud 🤨.
Super produit a première vue! Botte incroyablement légère et semble bien chaude!
The size of the shoes match. I have a converse 42.5 and I brought this shoes 42.5 and it fit perfectly.
Very comfortable!
"Great winter boots. Waterproof, very hot"
Tested on minus 15 degrees c for several hours. Keeps you warm.
Gifted this shoe to my daughter . Thank you Amazing Amazon . My daughter is so happy to receive this . Always order one size over for New Balance .
I have no idea what V1 were like but man I’m guessing they were grea because there are outSTANDING!
Perfect fit and amazing quality. My daughter just loved it.
This product is very comfortable. A real running shoe.🏃🏼‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏼‍♂️🏃🏻‍♂️
Good product at the price point. Will recommend to go for.
Nice shoes. Laces should have been a bit shorter though...
Excellent
My adult son has Down Syndrome and has a very short wide foot and it is very hard to find comfortable shoes for him. These fit well and are great all around. He loves them.
"It is so hard to find a stylish wide width sneaker. Especially, in youth sizes. My 12 yr. old has a wide foot and he is limited to brands and styles. New balance & Sketcher's are the only brands we can sometimes find. These are cute and fit slightly smaller for a wide shoe. Overall, I always seem to find everything on amazon. Happy with purchase and I love having Prime."
"Nice Shoe but  was too wide for her. we had gotten the extra wide, this was a nice purple,cute & nice style. We ended up getting another New Balance shoes and a size wide instead and returned these. No problem returning  and got the color she liked too. She wanted an aqua one in new balance style instead."
Fallen etwas kleiner aus. Habe sie erst einmal getragen. Danach waren meine Fersen wund. Hoffentlich gibt es sich noch
"Ich empfehle es zu kaufen, es ist ein wenig bequem, aber es sollte besser sein als das für den Markennamen"
"There looks nice but on my eyes kinda of fake, and big, I MEAN HUGE! I bought it for my husband and he has 6 pairs of Adidas all of them 8.5 and fits perfect! Those are wide and kinda of big, and they even looks huge."
"Good shoes, love the design, but they are very stiff, uncomfortable and cardboardy."
The fit
"Me siento muy bien con el zapato,es lo que esperaba"
I love this shoes! Don't believe he Yeezy hype and get yourself a pair of these. Also you can't beat the price!
"It's perfect, just a little too big. I got size 10.5, but it fit like an 11"
one note the tread is a small rock magnet gets easily caught in tread
"Weird shoes, but I like them. Comfortable, but the circular sole takes a little getting used to. Great for walking."
Good product!
Long time I was looking for a totally red sneaker until I found this pair. Love ADIDAS sneakers.
"As a Cole Haan wearer my entire life I've come to expect high quality materials and craftmanship in their products. I purchased these shoes for my Uncle (who first introduced me to Cole Haan) as a present. After inspection I decided to return them immediately. The fit itself was stiff and uncomfortable but, most notably, I found the materials cheap and plasticy. My suspicion is that these are knock-offs. If you're expecting authentic Cole Haan's, the price is too good to be true."
"Like many other reviewers, I had the same shoe from about 8 years ago with the Nike Air Technology. They were the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned as well.These are very close in size, fit, design and quality.Leather is a little different as the originals were a top grain( and are still perfect except the soles wore through) These are now made in India, so maybe different sourcing now, but very acceptable.Not sure the if soles will provide the same luxurious feel but I am going to keep these as they should break in OK."
"I had and have lots of leg/foot related issues over the years. I have flat foot as well. This shoe is perfect for my feet. It is wide and once the arch is inserted , I am very comfortable. Bit pricey. But I can walk without pain."
Much to narrow. Opening too small. Looks are everything.
These are great shoes. Very trendy and I didn’t add a picture as they look exactly like the picture in the ad. The quality is excellent and they are very comfortable.
"Not the same as the original pair. These are quite different. The leathers is stiff, so much that it hurts my feet. Never buying this again."
I have purchased many pairs of these over the last few years and they are always great comfortable shoes
Good quality shoes. Size is accurate.
"Happy with them, ordered wide and am glad I did.  Nice looking, comfortable shoe."
"Best shoes we ever bought. Comfortable, perfect fit. Excellent product."
"Super Schuhe, fallen normal aus. Blitzversand durch den Verkäufer Strandpassage. Alles bestens, vielen Dank :0)"
"Ich bin mit dem Schuh super zufrieden. Der sieht nicht nur gut szs, er trägt sich such angenehm. Kurz um empfehlenswert."
Alles bestens
Diese Schuhe sind phenomenal! Sie sitzen wie angegossen! Vielen Dank!
"So disappointed! I have the Apex natural wool sneaker. I love them, they are currently one of the only pairs of footwear I can wear that is comfortable. I got these because they look like the same shape and style, only different material. Not true! These are much smaller, the toebox is much less roomy. I cannot wear them at all and will have to return them. I was really hoping these were going to be the athletic shoes I have been trying to find for months. Back to the drawing board!Pros- Not bad looking at all. Seems supportive, moderate arch support. Choice of either the elastic waist or regular shoe laces, both are included. That he’ll did not seem too wide, which is a plus.not bad looking at all. Seems supportive, moderate arch support. Choice of either the elastic lace or regular shoelaces, both are included. The heel did not seem too wide, which is a plus.Cons- they seem to run a little small to me. Maybe about half size smaller than I expected. The toebox is shallow. My toe hit the top of the shoe without even moving."
Super light weight and so much air goes thorough these. I always buy apex for my extra wide foot. They fit perfect. I wear Orthotics and when you take out the insole tons of room for Orthotics.  As always great shoes from apex. Wore them to work out in past 2 days and no issues.
"It's the perfect pastel pink and surprising goes with any casual outfit. Maybe because of the stretchy material, the big kid size 5 felt a tad loose for me (I normally wear size 7 womens). Size length was fine, sizing half a size down might help to have a more snug fit."
Great shoes. Very comfortable and cute too.  I wear a women’s 7.5 or 8 and opted to get 6.  They fit.  A little large.  Super cute shoes. I went them to work because I walk a lot during the work day.
"Están hermosos el color la forma todo, llegaron muy rápido pedí talla 22 cm me quedaron grandes pero tengo el pie muy pequeño, yo creo que viene amplio si son de México pidan un numero menos que al habitual"
"Great shoes, super cute, but get dirty a little too easily"
Estan hermosos pero la talla es muy amplia...
Very nice and very good shoes.
CONVIENNENT TRES BIEN AUX PIEDS DE MA FILLE HANDICAPEE CE QUI EST TRES DIFFICILE A TROUVER
"My daughter loves them. She says they are comfy. However, we had to try many sizes before finding the right size. They are too big. My daughter normally wears 3.5 and we got 4 because other sizes were out of stock. The 4 fit me and I wear adults 7.5! The size that fit her was a 2 and it is a little loose but it doesn’t come out of her foot."
Sure was almost TWO SIZES TOO LARGE! My daughter is a 12. I ordered a 12.5 to be sure and I think I’m going to have to order a 10! I measured her foot and it’s exactly 7 inches long. A 12.5 should’ve been perfect. This prob isn’t real sketchers! Will be reporting for fraudUPDATE: I just revived a size 11 in black bc this color was not absolute. About 1/2- to a full size still too big! Idk what I’ll do
"These shoes are adorable!My daughter is 7 years old-normally wears a 13-the shoes for true to size, perfect fitI was worried as previous reviews say they run large-not so for us!"
"I had to re-order these shoes after the first pair arrived in pretty poor quality. The leather was incredibly creased on one of the toe boxes of the shoes, looking like the panels weren't sewed properly. You could see the stitching inside around the entire heel of the sole and there was a black stain on one of the shoes. Needless to say I contacted to Amazon unsure if these were authentic or fake Cole Hans, they assured me they were authentic so I decided to give it another shot and order a replacement pair. The second pair came in much better quality -- but do note that the leather is VERY paper thin and so there was still some wrinkling/creasing on one of the pairs. It was right where the toe box bends though so not as big of a deal. Also they do fit a little large so I sized down half a size (I'm usually a size 6 womens, I ordered 5.5)I haven't worn them for long periods of time yet, just around the house but here are thePRO'S:- Super light weight, comfortable- a beautiful clean, minimalistic look! more-so than Adidas Stan smith's- would make a great travel shoe, light weight easy to pack and would go with any outfitCON's- leather is pretty thin (hence why they're so light weight) so will need to see how these hold up"
"Decidí pedir estos tenis porque hace años tuve unos Cole Haan y me parecían lo máximo, eran súper cómodos y no me lastimaban para caminar. Cuando recibí estos no eran como los recordaba, por dentro eran incomodos y un poco rasposos. Además, me quedó muy grande y eso que pedí el mismo número que el anterior. Al final decidí devolverlos 😔"
"I made the mistake of not looking at the negative reviews. These are NOT real leather these are made of PLASTIC.  Not only that but at the bottom of the shoe there are two pieces of rubber that are supposed to meet that don't, I cannot tell if it goes all the way to the lining of the shoe or not. Very bad purchase on my part, I will be returning them and I would recommend others not to buy. For the same price you can get genuine leather shoes that will hold up much better over time."
It is like walking on air. Very comfortable and look great. The leather like make them more formal.
"Me encanta que son de piel, están muy cómodos y ligeros. Los recomiendo muchísimo."
Esta talla me quedó correcta sin embargo es medio número menor a la que siempre uso en está marca. Incluso con el mismo modelo.
These are great sneakers and quite comfortable after one full-day wear. I like they don't make my feet look too big either (I ordered a size 9.5). I've been a big believer in the comfort of Cole Haan shoes in the past and these don't disappoint.
"This dressy sneaker not only looks good with capris, jeans, yoga pants and summer dresses, the comfort was unbelievable.  No breaking-in period needed.  The leather was beautifully soft.  Size was true to fit."
"quedo justo a la medida , fiel a la tallamuy muy cómodos como todos los cole haan ..vienen con su caja en excelente estado :)"
Shoes came earlier than expected. Like the colour. I have narrow feet and it fits well. True size as per described. Hopefully it won't bite my feet.
"La talla viene normal de largo pero de ancho viene angosto, para mi genial porque se ajusta super bien al pie. El color es muy bonito, no es tan brillante como en la publicación, es un poco más mate. Recomendado al 100%"
"Son angostos pero en mi caso ajustaron muy bien, son elegantes y combinan con todo, creo que puede ser fácil lavarlos por ser de pura tela, hay muchos trucos para volverlos a blanquear por eso también me animé a comprarlos."
Me encantó la calidad y el color pero si me quedaron un poco justos del empeine y los lados. Si se tiene el pie ancho es mejor encargar medio número mas.
"La talla que ofrece el vendedor,no es lacrwal viene muy pequeño el tennis."
"Mi esposa ha tenido cirugías de columna y está instrumentada (barras y tornillos) y le compré estos tenis, le encantaron y es de los pocos que usa porque se le hacen muy cómodos."
"Estos zapatos son muy bonitos, amoldan perfecto al pie, no lastiman ni aprietan."
Están cómodos pero se despegaron muy rápido de los costados
"Me encantaron, se amoldan perfectamente a tu pie la talla está correcta"
No es posible he usado como 3 veces los zapatos y ya se les está despegando la suela estoy muy decepcionada
These sneakers are super cute. Normally I am a seven and a half and went with that unfortunately these run a little bit smaller than expected so I will be exchanging.
"Me encanta, pedir una talla menor"
"Great sneaker, comfortable too. Thanks"
My daughter really loves it and may order another one. Nice shoes.
"Came as shown in the picture.  Fits well and I really like the look of them.  Depending on how long they last, I would buy again.UPDATE:  They last almost three months."
I was nervous about buy shoes online but the fit is very good. The shoe is light and looks good. They are comfortable for all day wear but I wouldn't say they are a workout or running shoe. I work in an office and may walk after work and my feet felt fine. If I worked on my feet all day I think my feet would hurt. The bottoms seem to squeak a bit on some surfaces. (See picture). I like them and it was a good buy. So far I would recommend them. Although not as good or comfortable as Nike air max but the look similar (see picture)
Was looking for a Nike shoe and mistook the name Jarlif as a style not a brand.  The fashion shoe came in a cute case but it wasn't what I wanted.  Haven't tried them on but probably if they don't fit or are not comfortable I will probably donate them. Don't let the AIR on the side fool you.  Also they were delayed in arrival.  Gave 3 stars as average didn't look close at quality of construction because I had to leave.UPDATE Right fit. If you buy make sure to go a half size up. Word them to run errands. Were not comfortable for extended wear. Changed to 2 stars. Very deceptive. Nike should sue but I guess since the word AIR cannot be trade marked this company can get away with it. Not a good way to build a brand.
"I have spent thousands of dollars for ""sneakers"" over my lifetime----buying the pricier brands thinking they would give me true comfort while walking or jogging.  As an active 82 year old woman, I decided to give this shoe a ""try"" for walking my treadmill daily.  These shoes were like walking on air---literally that comfortable!!  They are far more comfortable than any athletic shoe I have ever worn.  I will recommend them to all my friends and family."
"My wife purchased these.. This is what is her review > This shoe is made very well. They are extremely comfortable. I bought them for work, and I am on my feet the majority of the time I'm working. I've gotten several compliments in them too. I love how they look and feel!"
"These are pretty sturdy and light.  They are comfortable, soft, and supportive.  I wish the shoe came up a little higher on the foot (more support for ankles) - during some exercises the foot moves in the shoe a bit and doesn't feel as secure.  No rubbing of the heel.  Holds up to vigorous exercise.Update: the tongue of the shoe is very narrow so it bunches up and can get annoying / slightly rub."

"I did a targeted search for Womens Nike shoe black (or something very close to that). My search results included many Nike shoes. I chose this shoe. When I received the delivery, I realized it was not Nike at all. I suppose I just assume it was because of my query and the athletic shoe said 'AIR' on the side. Perhaps I should've paid better attention. In the future, I will. I'll also be more aware of 'bait and switch.' At any rate, I returned the shoes and received a refund. I bought a pair of Nikes elsewhere."
"Nach nicht einmal 3 Monaten Tragezeit lösen sich die Nähte in Wohlgefallen auf, die Klettverschlüsse lösen sich ebenfalls auf, der Klett löst sich vom Band ab, wir mussten die Schuhe bereits mehrere Male nähen. Von einem Adidas Schuh erwarte ich mehr. Ich werde solche Schuhe nicht mehr kaufen und kann von dem Schuh nur abraten"
Always nice brand
Depuis son plus jeune âge je prend ces chaussures à mon garçon. C’est les seules qui s’usent moins vite que son pied grandit. Au final je les revend en bon état car elles deviennent trop petites. Alors que pour d’autre marques je suis obligé de changer car elles sont trop usées alors que la taille est encore bonne...  en bref super qualité résistantes et en plus elles vont avec tout!! TOP!!
Das war was ich erwartet habe. Die Adidas Superstar fur mein Sohn. Einfach super.
Bene
"Ottimo prodotto, le scarpe sono come quelle provate al Footlooker, soddisfatta"
Todo perfecto
Todo correcto
Bellissime come in foto perfetta per il mio bambino
Genial
"These shoes are falling apart after two months.Either the quality of these shoes has gotten so bad after a few years or maybe these are counterfeit - I've never seen a pair of shoes fall apart so fast.  the toes of the soles are peeling away and the front/side of the rubber sole has torn off completely.  Next time I'll buy my sauconys in a store...my kids old saucony shoes only started to wear out before he outgrew them, but I paid $60 for these and they didn't last barely two months of normal kid wear and tear.  hugely disappointed."
"After Stride Rite, these are my favourite shoes for my boys. They are comfortable, attractive and really easy to get on and off for my boys as well as tightening easily with the strap. They wore well and were well made - my boys pretty much wore these everyday and I've been buying this style consistently in larger and larger sizes as my boys grow with them. I would say the fit is a pretty true to fit - though they may seem small compared to Stride Rite. I find pretty much with most Stride Rite's they fit large. Even with wider feet, due to the design (criss cross elastic band stretch across the front), they fit nicely. Overall, a wonderful shoe!"
"The shoe gets 5 Starts, delivery gets 4. The shoe is great, very good quality, fits as expected (we purchased 9.5W) and son loves it. Delivery was fast with Amazon prime, unfortunately it was sent by FedEx and they refused to leave it at the door. Item had to be picked up at their warehouse and that was inconvenient considering we pay for prime membership and its convenience. Ordered a second pair today, hope its dropped off at the door (never had this issue with all other Amazon orders)"
"My 3-year-old loves the colour and the style of these shoes.  I love that they have extremely flexible soles compared to most other toddler shoes, which is important for developing feet.  These are attractive and durable.  The velcro is still sticky after months of wear.  They will still be in good enough condition to pass down to my youngest.  Highly recommend."
"Ordered a 10.5 thinking there would be lots of growing room (daughter is a 9.5/10).  There is very little growing room, leaving me to review them as a slightly smaller fit.  They arrived in a timely manner and we got them for an awesome price."
I bought these for my daughter who has size 3.5 feet. The size 4 fit amazing. And they are comfy and easy for her to use.Wish I could buy more in different colours.
"Very light, I think it's comfortable since my son loved it. But feels a bit cheaply made.Update:The velcro on both sides started detaching and actually holding the straps together.These shoes are very comfortable but really poor quality, thet are literally fallimg apart."
"Love the shoe and quality, but they fit a little on the small side compared to the Stride-Rite my twin boys were wearing.  We bought a size 11.5M Red/Black, vs a 11M Stride-Rite Made-2-Play Otis Navy/Royal, and the Stride-Rite was actually roomier length wise."
"The way the shoe is made it is quite tight across the top of the foot where the criss-cross elastics are....my 3.5 year old could not get it on himself. Since he needs to be able to dress himself at pre-school, I had to return these. They did however look very nice, were lightweight and Saucony is a great brand."
LOOOOVE these.  My 2 year old love these as well.  Been telling everyone about her pretty purple shoes. This pair is very breathable as most of the material is mesh.  Great for summer.  Great quality as well.
Sehr weicher und bequemer Schuh. Der Schuh kann gut mit Einlagen getragen werden. Grösse war genau wie erwartet.
Wonderful to find wide width shoe that is stylish and very comfortable.
Tolle Verarbeitung und angenehme Passform.Danke.
Excellent product! Quality service from Amazon!

Excellent shoes for kids!
"Als Berufspendler, der täglich lange Zeit mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln unterwegs ist und durch Wind und Wetter muss, habe ich lange nach einem Winterschuh gesucht, der meinen Ansprüchen gerecht wird:+  Die Sohle muss ein griffiges Profil haben, damit ich auch bei Schneematsch nicht ausrutsche.+  Außerdem sollte sie biegsam sein, damit die natürliche Abrollbewegung des Fußes nicht eingeschränkt wird.+  Sie sollte gute Bodenhaftung und deshalb eine möglichst große Auflagefläche haben (nicht so wie diese modernen halb nach oben gebogenen Fehlkonstruktionen)+  Der Schuh darf nicht durchweichen wenn ich durch ""Sauwetter"" und auch mal durch Schneepfützen muß,+  Die Füße müssen schön warm gehalten werden  (bei uns Frauen besonders wichtig!)+  Trotzdem sollte man auch bei einigen Stunden im warmen Büro keine Schweißfüße darin bekommen+  Und er sollte nicht zu klobig aussehen. Bei mir geht da das Praktische über das Modische ...Alle diese Punkte werden hier voll erfüllt. Ich habe sogar noch seitliche Bewegungsfreiheit, damit sich meine Zehen nicht zu eingepfercht fühlen, und man kann dank des Reißverschlusses schnell rein- und rausschlüpfen ohne mit steifen Eisfingern jedes Mal an der Schnürung herumfummeln zu müssen!!! Dadurch dass man (vorher) mit der Schnürung die Weite noch individuell anpassen kann, kann man die Schuhe auch mit dicken Socken tragen, wenn man will. Obwohl das Teddyfutter unten und innen rundum ansich schon mollig genug ist.Nur schade, dann man sowas nur unter der Rubrik ""Jungenschuhe"" findet und nicht auch unter Frauenschuhe  (ich trage Gr. 38, da passt das zum Glück noch). Also: klare Kaufempfehlung, auch für Frauen mit entsprechender Schuhgröße !!!!Ergänzung nach einem Jahr Tragen (natürlich nur bei Winterwetter):  Leider verabschiedet sich gerade das Innenfutter an der Ferse, bei beiden Schuhen, daher ziehe ich im Nachhinein einen Stern ab. Ich würde sie aber trotzdem immer wieder kaufen, da sie meine Füße in dem Jahr super warm gehalten haben und ich auch nicht damit ausgerutscht bin. Die Preise variieren natürlich ständig ..."
"Habe diese Stiefel meinem Enkel gekauft. Wir hatten den Stiefel letzten Winter in grau. Jetzt hat sichmein Enkel braun rausgesucht. Er ist 12 Jahre und hat Schuhgröße 39. Gr. 40 passt perfekt. Der Stiefel ist wasserdicht und sehr robust. Er hat ihn  in der Schule, sowie zum Schlittenfahren angehabt. Er sieht heutenoch fasst wie neu aus. Passt aber leider nicht mehr."
"Dieser Schuh ist in der gewohnten Superfit Qualität. Er ist robust, warm gefüttert und dank Goretex gibt es keine nassen oder feuchten Füsse. Das habe ich mit einer anderen Wasserdichten Membran (nicht Superfit) negativ erfahren. Durch die profilierte Sohle ist auch der nötige Gripp auf Schnee gewährleistet. Der Schaft ist hoch geschnitten und stützt dadurch den Fuß, also ideal für kleine Abenteurer."
Beste Winterstiefel für Kinder und Jugendliche. Die Stiefel sind wasserdicht und atmungsaktiv. In ihnen lässt es sich gut laufen. Einzig das Außenmaterial muss man sehr regelmäßig pflegen. Was aber normal ist bei Wildleder. Daher klare Kaufempfehlung!
"Sehr schöne und hochwertige Schuhe von Superfit, wie immer 100% wasserfest.Reißverschluss bei einem Schuh widerspenstig, für den Preis leben wir aber damit .Allerdings stinken die Schuhe, sehr komisch , bin sonst immer sehr zufrieden mit der Marke. 🤭"
"Wir hatten diesen Schuh bereits letztes Jahr und waren sehr zufrieden damit. Er hält super warm und ist durch den seitlichen Reißverschluß einfach an und auszuziehen. Leider mußten wir den Schuh dieses Mal zurück schicken, da er unserem Sohn -  der extrem schmale Füße hat - am Knöchel zu weit war. Schade, ansonsten sehr empfehlenswert!"
"Die Schuhe sind sehr bequem (innen eher kuscheliges Material) und passen mir sehr gut. Normalerweise trage ich Gr. 38 bis 39 und war hier mit 38 sehr gut bedient. Einziger Haken, der in anderen Bewertungen auch schon angeklungen ist: Leider waren die Schuhe sehr verkratzt.Regulär guter Kundenservice von Amazon, hat die Auswahl angeboten: Kostenloser Ersatz, Rückerstattung oder Preisnachlass).Angehängt ein Foto, damit sich potentielle Kaufinteressenten ein Bild davon machen können."
Diese Winterschuhe hat mein Sohn (10) sich selbst ausgesucht. Gut für Kinder mit hohem Spann geeignet. Robustes Schuhwerk und warm. Der erste Winterschuh der gegen Turnschuhe konkurriert.
Trotz Schuhweit weit ist der Schuh vorne viel zu schmal für die Zehen. Sie haben keinen Platz. Deshalb zurück.
"Was soll ich sagen. Sie sind warm, gemütlich und passen perfekt. Zum Glück gibt es sie in Gr. 43, in 42 wären sie mir zu klein gewesen. Echt tolle Stiefel, kann man nicht meckern. Und trocken bleibt man auch."
Perfekt. die Farbe ist auf dem verkaufsbild etwas anders aber in Wirklichkeit genauso wie ich mir das Rosè vorgestellt habe.
Unsere Tochter liebt diese Bisgaards und die Mutti auch :) neben der tollen Optik sind sie bequem und warm. Töchterchen ist schnell beim rein- und rausschlüpfen- perfekter Winterschuh für die Schule.

Scarpe da erba sintetica di ottima fattura con un look accattivante! Prezzo in linea con il prodotto.
"This shirt fit my son perfect. He’s 9 and a little on the small side ( short and thin). A kids size 8 shirt can go 2 ways, 1 just fit him, or be a little too short when he lifts his arms. A kids size 10 is way too big on him. But this shirt fits perfect. He’s not swimming in it and it’s not too tight or short."
"Since I was in a very bad car accident I need a wider, longer shoe. These are perfect for my needs. I couldn't find them anywhere but Amazon. ( My mobility is restricted.)"
Have worn this shoe for a number of years and find it is very comfortable.  Good value for the money.
"I have never seen anything like this. I tried them on the night before and took a few steps in the house approving of my new shoes. I put them on for church, and walked to my car parked in the driveway. From there it was a few yards to Sunday school. From there it was up just one flight of steps to the sanctuary. There I found a large chunk of foam in the floor at my pew. It seemed to have a shape, so I left it there. Maybe it was a part someone needed for something. We went to a restaurant to eat, and afterward I noticed the floorboard of the car was full of crumbles. Upon closer inspection, huge chunks had fallen off the sole of my shoe. I was just hoping it would hold together long enough for me make it into my house. I'm glad I didn't wear these to work. There would have been little foam crumb trails everywhere I went!"
"I have bought this particular brand of shoe (Propet Vista Walker, size 8EE) on numerous occasions before and I have always been super impressed and the fit was always perfect for my extra wide feet.  However, there seemed to be something different about the fit and the way these shoes balance on my feet and I am dissapointed and unable to wear them.  For some reason, they seem to be loose around the sides and stones are constantly getting in somehow (its hard to explain).  Also the left shoe fits a bit better than the right shoe.  The right shoe seems to throw my balance off so I tip to the right and I have developed a callous on my right foot since wearing them.  This has never happened before with previous Propet Vista Walkers.  I find I can not wear this pair at all unfortunately.  I have gone back to wearing my older Vista Walkers, same size, same brand and they are fine so no idea why the new pair is different to all the others I've purchased previously.  Its a mystery.  I wonder if the company have changed something in the manufacturing process or if I just got a pair of duds :("
"Unfortunately, in my case, these shoes made the balls of my feet burn after ten minutes of walking on a sidewalk. I feel they would give me calluses there easily. They are supposed to be comfortable shoes for diabetics, so I don't understand why they felt so hard on the bottoms to me. It's almost like they left out the cushioning. The shoe itself also seemed stiff. I usually Propet's black washable walker; they're great. But they don't come in beige or taupe or khaki, which I am looking for."
I have worn this brand for years and found the soles virtually indestructible.  Therefore I was shocked when the sole of the left shoe cracked up to the bottom of the footbed.  The seller requested pictures which I provided and hasn't responded since.  Extraordinarily disappointing.
My wife is not rough on shoes. But the bottom broke into two halves at the middle after not too long of use. Poor quality. Don't buy.
"The soles of this somewhat expensive shoe split across the ball of the foot yesterday. One shoe completely, the other is starting to split across the inner part of the sole. I have been wearing them to work (where I sit in front of a computer) since September 2017, except for 2 snowy months in winter, and at the end of March 2018, I will have to throw them away. A total waste of money. I am not hard on shoes. I have a pair of black New Balance bought at Sears five years ago that I still wear. I understand the term ""planned obsolescence"", but this is ridiculous for a pair of shoes that cost $90.00. Propet - get your act together!"
Do not waste you money on this.  The material on the outer part of the shoe is flaking off after only 4 uses
"ok i have feet shaped like a brick (size 7 1/2 2E) and shoe shopping is an unpleasant chore. i ordered these using the p/n  from the last pair that i had purchased in a local store. Because of the great price i got 2 pair, i use these for work and every day so i hope to extend the life of each by rotating them. while both pair of shoes fit i was surprised to find that i could tell a slight difference in each pair. just a very slight difference, but if i had not known how these shoes ""break in"" and stretch (being leather) i might have been put off a bit but i could not be happier with the product, quality, and fast delivery"
"Soy un 39 habitualmente (24cm) y decidi guiarme por los comentarios y pedí una talla menos y bien , además son bonitas PEROOOOO son estrechas y me hacen daño así que, después de media hora de uso van a wallapop."
"Pues llevo más de tres años comprando estas zapatillas y la verdad es que estoy encantado. Ahora es cierto que están algo más caras, pero bueno, como todo...Si las usas a diario no duran más de un año, la verdad, se nota que no son las auténticas pero están muy bien."
Es preciosa y nada que envidiar a la marca con más renombre. Victoria siempre cumple con las expectativas y quedan geniales. Mi hija está encantada con ellas. La talla es justamente la que se utiliza con el zapato habitual.
"Son muy cómodas y la talla es exacta ,yo uso 36 y me están bien . Lo único malo es que la goma de la suela esta amarillenta y queda horrible.Sí las quieres devolver te soplan 5 €.Decepción para el precio que tienen.Las Mustanas baratas y sin ese color feísimo."
"Comodas, después de un par de usos para que se amolde el pie.  Tallaje bastante similar a las All Star."
"Las zapatillas son bonitas pero no venía en su caja original, solo envuelta en la caja de embalaje lo que da que pensar que no sea marca original."
"Buen material, parecen resistentes y son bonitas. El número que pedí me queda un pelín grande, aunque es preferible a que me aprieten, y la tela al principio resulta un poco ""dura"", supongo que con el uso irá cediendo, como sucede con este tipo de calzado.Dependiendo de lo que duren, las volvería a comprar."
Molestan un poco al ancho....pero al usarlas unos dias ceden
"Me decidí por las reseñas buenas que tiene y no me a decepcionado, son cómodas y la talla es la correcta"
"Cómodas, se ajustan muy bien"
My son loves his shoes. I love them because they still look new after my active kid has been wearing them everyday since he got them.
"They took a minute to get used too but my son now loves these, great quality, great shoes"
Perfect fit
la calidad y echura es excelente
"Das Produkt ist genau so wie ich es wünschte. Es gab zwar beim Zoll etwas Probleme, aber es ging dann alles in Ordnung! Ich würde wieder kaufen👍"
"I like the NMD R1 by Adidas...so much so that I have bought a total of 5 for the time being. They are just overall comfortable, stylish and attention grabbing. Just make sure to match those nmd with color matching laced as well!"
"I saw a few questions and reviews saying that these are smaller, bigger, etc than expected. If you are comparing these to other NMDs then they fit as expected. I am a woman who wears a 7.5W, men's equivalent according to Adidas is 6.5M. I got a 6M because I believed the other reviews. They fit fine, but had I gotten the 6.5M I would have been better off.My recommendation if you are worried about size is to go to a local store, try them on and just order the size that felt comfortable at the store. If you have other NMDs go with their size.And yes, they are real, we inspected them on arrival, shining the light under the sole produces expected results. :)"
I love them. My favorite team colors
"Let me start off with i love these shoes ! They are nice, featherweight, and comfortable.I give it a four star because honestly i inspect my shoes my end to end and top to top. I found some chips on the shoes and some damage. Also it looked like it was deep clean which they did a good job on. But i saw some part of the shoe still kinda dirty. I collect shoes and i personally collect nmd. The buyer i got the shoes from were authentic. Came with original box and the box wasnt damaged.**Update**Tips============================How to tell if NMD Are fake-The shoe picture on the box is slanted like a banana like-The size tag should have 'MALE/MÂLE'-The size tag should have 13 digits in the bottom row are a unique security number. They have to be DIFFERENT on both the left and right shoe,-Make sure the shoes dont come in wrapped in plastic bag. It should be in a easy to tear paper with the adidas logo alittle faded-Make sure the part where you put in the laces is doesnt have extra leather sticking out-Make sure the sewing is legit, as in nothing looks wrong.They should be zigzag-The nipples or dots should never past more than 4 dots going vertical"
"Let me start by pointing out that I find these tennis shoes so comfortable that I've but 4 pairs (Utility Black/Solar Pink, Blue/Black/Coral, Trace Olive/Black/Lime, Black/Grey/Solar Pink). I have a wide foot and most tennis shoes seem to strangle my feet. However, the NMD R1 STLT provide the most comfortable fit of any sneakers I have tried. The knit mesh wraps around your feet and feels like you are wearing socks, while the boost sole gives a  responsive cushioning effect like you are walking on a cloud.I normally wear a size 11, but I purchased an 11.5 this is to compensate for the Dr. Scholl's plantar fascites insoles that I use in all my shoes. I also recommend wearing low cut cushion tab socks to cushion the ankles as these tennis shoes do not provide cushion for the ankles."
This shoe came recommended by various running sites which is why I made the investment. I was just looking for a solid shoe to use for walk/runs. The shoe arrived and I was a little surprised by the construction. I tried it on and it fit nicely. I wore it out on a short walk with my wife not pushing myself. Then I took them out on a longer walk/run at a higher tempo and the heels of the shoes tore up my heels. They were bloody and battered by the time I was done. Needless to say I was anything but impressed.
"They are really comfy, I love the sock shoe style. The green color isn't too flashy, at a distance they are a more muted green which I like, the closer you get the brights show through. I haven't tied them tightly so I don't know how well they perform for actually athletic activities, I use them as daily wears that are better walking shoes than a generic street shoe."
"I'm a bit of a Sneaker-head.  I don't have a footwear ""Beatles or Stones?"" attitude, all sneakers manufacturers are created equally - to bless us with awesome apparel.  I missed getting this NMD colour wheel when they were first released, so seeing these on Amazon, for a bargain price made the world a better place.  The fit is wide across the toes giving you max spread, they are slightly ""short"" though, so I'd suggest a half size bigger than you'd buy Nikes or other Adidas.  Boost sole is super comfy, PrimeKnit upper (basically strong stretchy material) gives support but tonnes of movement.  Laces are decorative - I'm totally fine with that."
"The Ideal User for This Shoes.I wore this pair of shoes about a few weeks and it was extremely comfortable for people who would like to go to gym to do some trainings or street run for about 30 miles a week. Personally, I do street run or jog in a gym about 3 miles daily and this shoes can protect my feet very well. Also this shoes is flexible, it is easy to wear without taking care about shoelaces. For people who are long distance runners, this shoes can decrease the vibration when you step on the ground and protect you knees. It can help you to keep stability when you are running and increase your balance.What Size You Should Buy?This pair of shoes fit a little bit bigger than normal shoes’ size. But I still recommend to go true to size on this shoes, because when we are doing some sports or jogging, our feet will be bigger than normal. If we buy this shoes for a half size down, it may be a little small and hurt our feet.What features this shoes has?For this pair of shoes, its breathability is excellent. When I am jogging at gym, I feel fresh and cool on my feet. I am a person who is likely to sweat when doing some sports, this shoes can keep my feet dry and comfortable. But if say the ability of water resistance, this pair of shoes cannot resist water at all, and if I wear this shoes on the street for a long time, I will feel cold because this shoes is thin and light, and it is ideal for summer.This shoes uses Boost technology of adidas to makes the shoe sole flexible and comfortable, and it has a fantastic looking so that when the first time that I saw this pair of shoes, I said “this is what I am looking for”. For its durability, I heard that the shoes with Ultra Boost technology didn’t do well on it. But for Boost technology, I wore this shoes for jogging and daily use since I received it and it did great so far. We can expect this shoes can handle heavy duty jobs.Thank you for your time, and if you have any questions, you can leave a comment below and I will response as soon as possible."
"Love them they are super comfortable and lightweigh.Use them daily for walking,Perfect fit."
Shoes are nice. I probably won’t be running in them but I will be wearing them casually at the gym or even for a day out. They are very comfortable and light. I highly recommend them.
"For the price, I wasn’t expecting a super high quality shoe. Bought them mainly for the looks of an all white sporty shoe. They definitely don’t fit true to size. I wear an 11 and bought an 11, and they seem to fit like an 11.5-12. I would highly suggest you buy down half a size from what you normally wear. They aren’t very cushiony in the soles, but they aren’t uncomfortable either. Very lightweight! Good price. Would I buy again? Yes, just would make sure to order down half a size!Edit: I washed them in my washing machine, as white shoes don’t stay white forever, and not only did it clean them right up, but it also shrunk them just enough to fit even better then when I bought them! (Let them air dry!!) I left my original review so you could see what my first thought was. I am adding another star because these shoes (after washing them) are a really good shoe! They have also gotten more comfortable after washing and wearing more."
"This review is not a joke they are so bad for your feet it's absurd.Amazon should stop selling these.These shoes are for those who desire orthopedic surgery in the future, they are so bad I have let others try them just to see how bad they are. The feeling among my friends is you're better off walking barefoot unless there's glass on the floor. I then showed them to a podiatrist who said they were worse for your feet than any shoes he'd ever seen at payless. Please for your own good, especially if you have arthritis, do not buy these!!!!!!!!!"
"I’ve been wanting white shoes for awhile now. Decided to get these in both high top and normal.  For the price you are paying you are definitely getting your moneys worth.  I will say you most likely will not be able to run in these.  Even tied I’m able to pull them off fairly easily, even the high tops. The material feels like gauze tape which is surprisingly comfortable.  I walked around in them and went to get the mail and experienced no problem with the shoes.  I got these more as a statement piece.  Hence the super gay socks and pink shorts lol.  I will be wearing these to the gym and maybe out events.  I’ll most likely be ordering in other colors as well. I don’t expect these shoes to last a long time as it feels as if you could cut through the entire shoe with scissors but at this price I most likely won’t mind replacing them."
"Their shoes are SOOO comfortable!! I cannot stress how easy they are to wear around. Sometimes you’ll forget they’re even on! Yes, people will stare at them because they look like really expensive shoes but they aren’t! I’ve had so many people compliment me while wearing them. I will however warn you that the ankle support is nonexistent. When I first wore them, I nearly rolled my ankle thinking it was like my normal sneakers. They are as depicted in the photos. Soft and flexible but have a really clean shape to them! I’m considering buying a second pair!"
"Alright, I bought these because I’m cheap and tell you, I wish I had saved my money.They are bright brilliant white and light weight that’s what appealed me to them, you know, gotta fit in at the gym. But these! Will not help me in anyway working out. The foam soul has zero traction, I could see myself slipping on the tiniest of water droplets. The liner pops out every time I take them off and they offer no support for jumping and squatting. I wouldn’t dare run in these either.So learn from me and save your money and invest in a more quality product."
I ordered these for my husband who had a very large foot and when traveling makes luggage weigh alot.  These shoes are weightless and husband loves them!!! We used them on our last cruise and we will be ordering more in different colors to have for other travel adventures.  He highly reccomends them!!!!
"Really comfortable shoe, I was expecting to be no as good as the shoe  I was replacing, but turn out this shoe is more comfortable btw; I normally wear a size 10, but this one I had to order 10 1/2 ( they sold out10 ), but turn out to be perfect fit."
"My husband is a bellman& also does vallet at the Four Seasons. He said this is the most comfortable shoes he’s had by far & prior to this one, he had sketchers & adidas. He would not pay a big price ever again for something that is not as comfortable & that’s only going to get all dirty. He loves how it’s breathable being that he sweats during work being on his feet all day. This has lasted him for a while now & I just ordered a new pair since he is finally going back to work after being on furlough for a year now. We recommend for sure. Can’t beat the price & the feeing you get."
"Well I bought these shoes, because I've read & been told how good Brooks shoes are.  So I figured I'd give them a try.  The side of the sole digs into the side of my foot.  As soon as I put the shoe I felt it.  As my first pair of Brooks I was disappointed.  Maybe the kind I got had a bad cut or glue job.  The shoe also seemed a bit more narrow than what I was expecting. Either way I will be returning, and probably won't try the Brooks brand again."
"These did not work for me. I have narrow feet (usual size 10N) but since reviewers said these ran narrow, I decided to try them. I ordered a half size up as recommended, so 10.5 medium. They were very roomy and looked large on my feet. They seemed comfortable enough at first try-on, though, so I decided to ignore my vanity and keep them. Yet after wearing  for several days straight doing remodeling work on my house, I found I had heel pain at night. Decided to return and order another style in 10N since the Range does not come in that size. If you normally wear a narrow shoe, I do not recommend these. I would also say you do not need to order a half size up. These fit like a 10.5 medium, as listed."
I absolutely love the style and look of these Brooks. Unfortunately one on and tied they develop an uncomfortable crease in the toe area which makes for an unwearable shoe. I tried 3 different pairs and sizes of this same shoe and every pair creased in the toe area and rubbed my toe the same way (see pictures). I only wore them around my home for about 30 minutes and the crease became too uncomfortable. Sadly have to return and will have to find another more comfortable model. All other aspects of the shoe are great!
"I love Brooks running shoes. I've been using them for nearly 10 years, and I've loved every pair I bought. Sadly, this pair doesn't sit straight on one of my feet. The left shoe slips outward while walking/running. I've never had that issue with a shoe. I walk for work, and on my first day put 5 miles on this shoe, trying to right it as I went the whole day. It's as if the cushion on the bottom was displaced slightly or is wonky, like a pillow you've put in the dryer. I wish I could return them, since I paid $60. Their okay for driving, which I also do for work, so I keep them handy for that. But I'm disappointed in Brooks at this point."
The left shoe has a lot of dried glue on the tongue and near two of the eyelets. I also sized up 1/2 size and these are still snug.
"While I love Brooks shoes and wear them also as work shoes, these were a little disappointing.  I wore these the day after I received them and ended up slipping on asphalt and landing on my knee.. they were also slick in my kitchen as if they had oil on the soles.. They are comfortable but not safe to wear. Since I threw the box away I cannot return so basically a waste of money as far as a shoe for work. (I am a nurse). I would not recommend these for running since I slipped on asphalt just walking."
Followed the measurement instructions and ordered half a size up but it was too small. Reordering a full size up (7 instead of 6).The shoe is well constructed.
"I ordered these in a size 7. The length was good but they were very narrow.  I had to really loosen the laces and it still felt really tight width wise, and I don't even have a wide foot. I wound up returning them."
"I am a true 8.5 in all shoes including other models of Brooks but for some reason, I couldn't even get my foot into these so had to send them back. The shoe itself is a nice style though just the sizing is super weird."
Get brooks your feet won’t hurt anymore they said so I got a pair!!! Yeah my feet fury still! I walk an average of 8 miles a day between 2 jobs ! I’m not impressed!
"Ormai a mia figlia compro solo queste scarpe, oltre ad essere di ottima fattura, sono comode e consentono al piede di fare i movimenti giusti.Ho preso anche la versione maschile per regalo a un amichetto, sono entrambe stupende!"
Unsere Tochter hat sich besonders über die beigelegte Superhelden-Maske gefreut. Schuhe sind top und sehen klasse aus.
Perfette.
Sehr schön
Bello e confortevole
Super jolie et confortable
My daughter loves these! Perfect shoes for a super hero lover! Typical great skecher quality and comfort. Fit true to size.
"Die Schuhe passen perfekt zur gewählten Schuhgröße. Im Gegensatz zu vielen günstigen Marken überstehen die Schuhe von Kappa den täglichen Gebrauch durch Kinderfüße ohne Beschädigungen. Hier ist das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis wirklich gut. Auch in der Waschmaschine kann man sie reinigen, wenn sie stark verschmutzt sind.Für mich neben der Schuhmarke Sketchers die besten Kinderschuhe."
"Nach nicht einmal 1 Monat löst sich der Schuh auf GANZ schlechte Qualität. Absolut nicht zu empfehlen, egal zu welchem Preis aber so darf eine Qualität nicht sein, ich bin sehr enttäuscht."
"Tolle Sneakers, die mein Sohn im letzten Sommer gar nicht mehr aus ziehen wollte. Die Schuhe sind sehr robust und halten eine Menge aus. Der Preis ist spitze. Klare Kaufempfehlung"
Ich habe bestellt aber wir haben nicht ausprobiert für unsere Sohn weil sind  zu groß.. Trotzdem sieht aus gut und gut Qualität sind. Meine Empfehlung eine oder zwei weniger Nummer bestellen
"Schuhe nur geöffnet und berührt, danach sofort aus der Wohnung entfernt und minutenlang die Hände gewaschen.Dennoch stark an der Haut anhaftender Geruch.Extrem starker Chemiegeruch. Unhaltbar derartige Artikel für Kinder anzubieten."
"Scarpe assolutamente non originali, fanno puzzare i piedi al bambino perché fatte di materiale davvero scadente."
"Leider habe ich die Schuhe in blau statt in grün bekommen.Sie sehen aus wie auf dem Bild. Für den Preis (knapp 40,-) habe ich allerdings ein bischen dickeres/festeres Material erwartet.Langzeittest steht noch aus."
Bien. Pero tiene tan poco trozo de velcro que queda pegado muy poco trozo. De todas formas no se ha despegado nunca. De momento...
"Die Schuhe sind sehr schön , farben kräftig."
Der Schuh sieht gut aus und ist federleicht. Auch ein toller Hausschuh für den Kindergarten oder die Schule.
"These boots are such great quality, seem warm and have a great tread. The kicker- they fit a whole size small. Will be returning and disappointed"
Good boot but top strap just slows down getting on and off.
"Very comfortable and stylish, but have a major issue that there is no strap in the back to help pull them on.  nearly impossible to put on without a shoehorn."
"I purchased these for light trail hiking , as an alternative to my heavier hike if boots ( Moab) . So far I love them. Comfortable right out of the box. Lots of cushioning and support. I ordered an 8.5 and a 9 because some reviewers thought they ran big. My usual street shoe is 8 1/2, although I wear 9.5 in my hiking and running shoes ( ASIC gel kayanos).  The 9 ‘s were perfect. 8.5 too short for hiking."
"The insole had zero support. After a few walks, my feet hurt so bad I couldn't keep using the shoe.  I bought and put in a new insert and the band over the top of the shoe digs in so bad it is impossible to wear. Unless you want a shoe with zero support go with something else. My husband also bought this brand of shoes and his had actual support in the shoe. Not sure why the women shoe is more poorly supported.  A huge waste of money."
"I was hoping for good arch support and these do NOT have much. My feet were hurting after just a couple of miles because of this, and it’s probably not ok to return them since they’ve already been worn outdoors.  Other than they, they are nice shoes, I feel very stable in them, and they run close to true to size (I bought size 8.5), or maybe just a tad bit on the small side."
True Fit. I wear a 9.5 bought a 9.5. I have a bunion on my right foot the toe box is roomy enough without having to buy a wide width. Another thing I need in a shoe is stability this shoe has stability. The higher side and back isn’t an issue!! Great Price!!
"I searched high and low for a hiker shoe that wasn’t the “bulky” boot style and was lightweight.  This hiker not only fit the bill but was phenomenal during my hikes through sand, mountain trail climbs, rocky terrain, etc.  Although not waterproof, that want a big concern for me as I didn’t plan to be in water.  A lot of people said the rear rubbed their heel area around their ankle but I had absolutely no issue.  I literally wore them on 8-10 miles hikes right out of the box.  M extremely happy with this purchase and would highly recommend if you are looking for a great hiker without the heaviness and bulkiness of a hiker boot."
"I have worn Merrells for many year so,Cons: I understand that some hiking shoes tend to be heavy but these are too heavy for me-- like weights on my feet. And while I have no arch issues with my feet, I was surprised that my arch felt overly stretched with each step because the soul was so flat.Pros: Nice looking shoe, well-made, comfortable except for the arch issue and weight.Conclusion: I will keep these shoes and add my own supports inside. But they could have been better. I will need to get something lighter, as well."
"I waited to wrote the review until they were really tested. As with my Merrell hiking boots, these needed no break in time. Several days of wearing at work they seemed good, but they later proved to be great. We spent two days walking in the city, easily 10 miles a day on pavement and up and down curbs and steps. My feet were supported, and not sore at all. I hadn’t found a good city shoe until now. They were breathable, yet not so full of holes that I felt the wind like with some shoes. I’ve had my hiking boots for about 3 years now and they don’t show signs of wear, so I except these shoes to be the same."
"The shoe appears well constructed and has good support. However, it was so tight that it hurt to put it on no matter how much I loosened the laces. I hard marks on my feet when I took them off after a few hours of wear. I bought the same size I always wear and have never needed a wide width shoe. These are going back."
"I normally wear a 7.5 and I feel like this shoe is true to size in length. BUT the tongue of this shoe is attached and feels like there is a tight band across the top of my foot, so much so that it left indentions after only 10 minutes of wearing them just inside my house. I ended up returning those shoes because of this reason. They felt like a comfortable sole and i have had shoes in the past with an attached tongue but these were just to tight across the top. Otherwise good shoe."
"I have loved Merrell shoes for decades.  I discovered them after the first time I had plantar fasciitis and I own all types which I enjoy during all seasons of the year.  I received this pair of hiking shoes on August 7, 2021.  After wearing them for less than a half a dozen times the shoelace aglet was either missing or came off.  This of course will eventually mean the shoelace will no longer be useful or work properly.  Amazon makes returning items easy, but nonetheless it is still a pain to return the shoes and I will be without good hiking shoes until I get new ones.  I certainly expect more from Merrell products.  Going forward, if this is reflective of the quality of Merrell's products I will not be purchasing any more."
War leider zu groß
"Die Turnschuhe sind weiß und haben grüne Streifen. Vorn sind sie gelb abgesezt.Die Sohle ist ganz flach.Die Schuhe sind sehr bequem. Man läuft darin sehr gut. Sie sind für Sport und Freizeit gut geeignet.Die Sohlen lassen sich heraus nehmen. Dabei sieht man sehr gut, dass die Sohle in verschiedenen Zonenaufgebaut ist. Diese Zonen haben unterschiedliche Härten, so dass der Fuß gut abgestützt wird.Die Schuhe passen mir gut. Sie entprechen genau der angegebenen Größe."
"El producto es de muy mala calidad, no son asimétricos, las costuras estan mal hechas, los cortes y las proporciones. Cuando mi hijo se las puso una se iba totalmente de lado por lo más confeccionadas y cocidas que estan.No las recomiendo"
"Estas pantuflas están hermosas y de muy buena calidad, las recomiendo"
"Viene de muy buena calidad, me encantó que la suela no se resbala"
"My son picked these out because he looooves dinosaurs and well... how cute?! But literally 5 minutes after they were unboxed... one of the dang horns fell off! LITERALLY BRAND NEW! And they’re broken! My 3 year old is super upset, as am I. But I have to find something to send them back on my own and print out a damn return label which is bs because everything is closed so I can’t ship it back that easily."
"I can't believe anyone says these fit ""true to size"". I'm an adult female, with size 8.5 feet, and my daughter's ""size 4-5"" slippers fit me perfectly. (Maybe most people like a loose fit to their slippers? ) Other than that, though, they are great. They lasted about a year with everyday wear, which, for me, is good for slippers. So I'm buying myself another pair of ""size 4-5 kids"" slippers (for my size 8.5 adult feet)."
"My granddaughter loved this slipper, but was disappointed because it won't stay on. The back is too low and it keeps coming off of her feet. She won't wear them."
"My son is autistic with SPD (sensory processing disorder) & very particular. He LOVES these slippers! They are so comfortable that when he gets home from school he immediately exchanges his tennis shoes for his slippers! From my perspective not only do they have a hard bottom in case he steps outside, but are also machine washable! Exactly what I was looking for!*I ordered up a size giving him a little growing room, but they still fit very well!"
"These are great slippers EXCEPT for the poor sewing of the horns on the top.  One horn was falling off when they arrived, and within 2 days, 3 more horns were falling off.  I sewed them all back on tightly, but this may be a problem for someone with no needle and thread."
My daughter is 8 years and is NOT rough with shoes at all. She wore her new Koala slippers on Christmas and within a few hours one of the puff ears fell off. Then not even 2 days later another ear came up so all the stuffing is exposed. I'm trying to convince my daughter to return them (they are completely sold out of her size now to try another pair although reading other reviews this seems to be a problem) but she really loves the look of them so we will probably just keep them and try to glue it back together. I cannot recommend these slippers to anyone unless you want your child upset that they fall apart immediately. Dearfoam has lost me as a customer. How could they sells such a junky product for $20 and get away with it???
My daughter loves dinosaurs so these slippers were just too cute to pass up.  They were no longer available on the Dearfoams website so I was sooo excited to find them on Amazon.  My daughter wears a size 8 (toddler) shoe currently so I chose the 9-10 and they are perfect for her.  She can easily put them on and take them off by herself.  I really love that they are washable so we can keep them smelling fresh instead of like sweaty kid feet lol.  Perfect stocking stuffer!!!
5歳の息子に購入。春になったら山にのぼると、はしゃいで気に入ってくれました
Buscábamos un calzado para entretiempo que no fuera endeble y sobre todo cómodo. Hemos acertado. Las compramos de oferta por 13€ y ha sido una súper compra :)
Muy guapas y cómodas
trés contente de mon achat ! chaussure très solide ! je recommande !
So cool
"An sich ist das Produkt super, allerdings hat es eine entscheidende Schwäche. Er trocknet einfach viel zu langsam, die Halterung für den Fuß besteht von Innen aus Stoff, wodurch sich das Wasser einsaugt und man relativ lange braucht, bis es getrocknet ist.Wenn ich Sie Abend nach dem Spiel raus lege zum trocknen und am kommenden Mittag / Morgen wieder los möchte, sind Sie oft nicht trocken."
"Diese Badelatschen sind Super. Sie passen sehr Gut, die Sohle ist dicker als bei anderen Marken, und daher wohl auch so wunderbar Weich. Es läuft sich sehr Angenehm. Diese Latschen kann ich sehr Empfehlen."
"Schon mehrfach gekauft, sowohl für Männlein also auch für Weiblein."
Très bon rapport qualité-prix
high quality
Los uso para entrenar CrossFit y al momento han cumplido el objetivo.
"I love this shoe, it's my 2nd pair (different colour).  It does fit a little snug across the width, but what I expected.  Shipping took a little longer than expected."
Size runs a little long. Half size too long.
"This is the best all around fitness shoe I’ve owned. Speed TR’s can do it all, I’ve done everything from squats to short runs to playing basketball in these and they handle it all more than capably. They don’t look too bad when worn casually either. Buy them.*Edit* Still love the fit and look of these shoes, but the outsole wears away very quickly. Wore them for about 3 weeks and chunks of the grip started tearing away."
I had a previous pair of these years ago that I loved. This pair were very flimsy and felt extremely cheap.
"I have worn almost everything in the Reebok crossfit area of shoes and these fall into that same great on the turf, in the gym but not so much on the street shoe. They are hard on the bottom which makes them great for Olympic lifts and turf work but anything more than 400 a meter sprint and I don't think you will like this shoe."
"They fit as expected, I really like the color and style.Very disappointed of these shoes as I was expecting them to last a lot longer.Only 3 1/2 months of using them and they are already starting to get a hole on the mesh as you can see in the pictures I uploaded.Not what you are expecting for $90 shoes designed for crossfit.The mesh material seems is not able to be made for some intermediate workouts.Do not waste your money on shoes that  you will not be able to get not even a quarter  of it supposedly lasting life."
"These shoes are great and are very stable for speed work, and changes of direction when doing sprints. They also have a very solid and stiff sole which is ideal for having a solid base when doing strength training. If you have the ankle mobility to do squats without needing the wedged lifting shoes these are going to give you a very stable base. My only complaint is that the inserts don’t quite fit against the inside of the show on the side with this pair and it pinched my heel a little bit the first time I wore them. After tightening the laces a little different I was able to fix that issue. Overall I’m happy with them, and would recommend them to anybody looking for a training shoe. These are definitely not ideal for distance running though!"
"I love these Reebok sneakers. I’ve been a long time wearer if the Reebok Nano, but the newer models have become more narrow.I was worried at first, but the puppies have plenty of room in the “toe box” area for my hobbit feet! Feel great in the gym for my heavy lifting as well as my plyo-metric work. I use them occasionally for casual wearing also."
"An earlier model of this shoe we’re my favorite pair of gym shoes ever, I was super sad to receive these — much cheaper materials and not the same feel — toe box was narrower and I could tell they were going to fall apart quickly — they were sadly an instant return"
"These are super cute and appear well made. However, I'm a true 6 but read the other reviews and ordered the 6.5 just in case. Not only are the shoes too small, but I legitimately cannot even get my foot inside them! These are labelled ""6.5"" but they are clearly no bigger than a 5.5, maybe even a 5. If you must buy these, order at LEAST a size up, if not more - but honestly I would not recommend buying them at all, because if they can't get something as simple as the shoe size right, I would be surprised if the actual construction of the shoe held up."
The fit is perfect and they are so comfortable and sturdy. But the look - they looked even better than the picture. When they came I had to wear them right away and I think I may live in them!
"I bought these as a Black Friday deal, best shoe I’ve bought in awhile. Fit exactly how I expected (I usually only wear adidas so if you’re used to adidas sizes and know your size it’s perfect) and supports my feet while I work. Super comfy, highly recommend!"
Very good quality.
These shoes are very comfortable but just after a few days I started noticing the green color fading off and the white cloth underneath coming through which made the shoes very spotted and looking very odd.  More and more keeps fading off each day.  I am very disappointed especially because they are not inexpensive shoes.
"I wanted to love these soooo bad because they are so stinking cute!!! BUT as hard as I tried they just were not comfortable to me. Standing in them for 2 minutes and my feet would just hurt. The footbed was too hard. I even bought a wonderfully thin soft memory foam insert (so the shoe didn’t fit too tight and I ended up keeping the insoles because I loved them) but I found no relief. I had such high hopes for these from the amazing reviews, but I had to send them back. They were true to fit. They weren’t narrow (and I have wide feet- so that says a lot) and the length was fine. They were just hard and made my feet sore. But many other people I know love them. Hope you have luck with them!!"
"Came brand new in adidas shoe box. They’re super cute! I ordered an 8. They fit comfortably but if you like a bit of extra space between your toes & the end of the shoe, id say to order a 1/2 size larger than usual. These will make great nursing shoes. Very comfortable to walk in."
"I have purchased and returned many pairs of black sneakers over the past several months (thanks Amazon Prime) because all my usual brands (Puma, Asics, Reebok) have either changed in sizing or quality. I usually wear size 8.5 to 9 in sneakers and got an 8.5 in these based on reviews. The fit of these Adidas are exactly proportioned to my feet: wide at the toe box for my mild bunions; close-fitting and supportive at the arches for my flat feet; and narrow at the ankle to keep from slipping. The fabric is cool and stretchy without feeling cheap, but I will have to wear a different, more water-resistant pair for rainy days. I also like the subtle black-on-black print, black sole, and wide laces. Finally, a keeper!"
"These are my 2nd pair I've bought. The newer Edge Lux are made from recyclable materials, and were so tight that they hurt. They were so cute on, but I couldnt get past the way they felt. I found these shoes online since I cannot find them in stores anymore, and they are exactly like the ones I bought last year at my local sporting goods store.I am a size 7, and they fit like they should. I wear them to work as a nurse, and would wear them daily doing everything from yardwork to working out to amusment parks. They don't rub my skin when my socks are too low, and they dont hurt my feet. Now, they don't have thick pads of comfort, or a thick pad to walk on like some other brands, but I didnt want that. I would not recommend using these shoes to run or jog for exercise because they arent supportive enough for that. These are lightweight, and do not look bulky so that I can wear them with leggings and shorts without feeling like I have heavy looking shoes on.They are better than mesh because they feel like sock material over your feet. I love that because I dont like to have sweaty feet when I wear my shoes all day."
"This is now my 8th pair of these as I have most of the colors.  Why so many- because it is the most comfortable sneaker on earth and versatile enough for working out, running errands and even wearing to work- hence why so many colors.I have arthritis in both knees, Achilles tendinitis in both feet, and am a life long flat footed person- I put on these sneakers and I feel like my feet are on air.  I over pronate  when I walk, which worsens my knee pain, but in these, my foot is well supported allowing me to walk briskly, without pain.This rose gold color is now my favorite color!"
"The side to side tread pattern will break your ankle on mud, ice, or snow. There is nothing to stop lateral sliding on slick surfaces. Also the front lip game unglued on the first hike. They look good though, should be fine for social distancing or Subaru driving."
"These are the coolest looking best quality shoe I have purchased that is not a boot. Do not doubt just buy them from the moment I put them on you could physically feel the quality wrap around your foot, Great arch support as well. What are you waiting for ? go ahead and buy them."
Las deportivas son muy bonitas lo malo que me mandaron un sapato media talla menos y la otra normal y tube que pagar el envío de la devolución solo espero que me devuelvan el dinero...
These are a nice lightweight sneaker shoe alternative to the Merrell hiking shoes I usually wear every day.  I recommended them.
Abbastanza robuste e comode (a detta di mia figlia).Calzano giuste. Suola discretamente flessibile.
Love them. Cool looking; received lots of comments. Very comfortable.
Muy chulas y comodas para mi hija ya es el modelo que siempre hace servir
"Very happy, the sinkers look great and fit comfortable."
"Es cômoda, todo y que la horma es algo estrecha. Cogí medio número más y aún así es ajustada.Por lo demás perfecto! Recomendable"
I’m a teacher and am on my feet all day. It’s important to have a shoe that is comfortable and supportive as well as versatile. When a shoe provides all of that while also earning compliments from my students… that’s just icing on the cake.
Son de color más oscuras de lo que aparece en la foto pero mejor menos sucias
These shoes give my foot amazing support and they are super comfortable. Love the retro style. I bought my first pair from Dillard’s and was so happy to find it on Amazon. I am super satisfied!
Mein Sohn hat sich sehr über die Schuhe gefreut.Und sie passen super.
These are awesome!!
No recomiendo para nada. Muy bonitas pero malísima calidad para ser la marca que es. Me siento estafada.
este proveedor mando mal los tenis que yo pedi y no conforme con eso ahora que quiero volver a pedirlos (pasaron 4 dias ) les aumento en un 80% su valor creo que por eso mando mal los tenis por que se equivoco en el precio y me obligo a que los devolviera para no perderle
"Son exactamente como los esperaba, muy buena calidad, muy cómodos."
"CALIDAD PUMA,  YA LO SABEN ES COMUN EN PUMA OFRECER UN EXCELENTE PRODUCTO A UN PRECIO JUSTO."
"Tenis muy cómodos, bonitos, de buenos materiales, lucen excelente y lo mejor de todo los encontré a un excelente precio."
"De lujo,super ligeros muy comodos!"
"todo bien, solo un poco tosco el modelo, pero llego perfecto"
"Son excelentes, me siento satisfecho con la compra"
Noticeably softer and springier when running when compared to cheap shoes.
Ligeros y muy cómodos
These shoes are great. they came on time and look just like the photo. the colors are true and just what i needed to go with my outfit. thank you Amazon.
"The product is nice was delivered even earlier than than expected.However, the color is not yellowish as in the picture but it is simply brown"
This is for my son and he loves it. Nice looking and good quality.
"j'ai acheté ces chaussures pour mon père, elles sont belles. bon rapport qualité prix"
It’s what l wanted very happy as it fits like a glove perfect fit thank you
Confortable.
Parfait
Got it of a sale.  Good shoes.
"It appears that Clark's went on an acquisition spree a few years ago and purchased 'unstructured', bostonian' and other brands. I had unstructured Sheridan when it was a stand alone company and it was the best and most comfortable dress shoes ever about 7 years ago. Looked like Clark's adopted all their 'comfortable' shoes under the unstructured brand. Sometimes, other brands like bostonian are sold under the unstructured brand which is misleading. I've spent so much money trying to buy the most comfortable shoes that look good and end up being a 50/50.Coming back to these shoes, I'm blown away by how comfortable they are and dressy. I have a function to attend with the wife and she wants the shoes to be dressy and looks very good and sharp. Very fortunately, it's comfortable as well so everyone wins. I'll be looking for open box deals on 12W as I found one for less than $50 which I jumped on."
"I wish I could give 0 stars. Fit and comfort were fine. I have only had these shoes for 2 months and they are worn out! For $170 I got $165 of comfort and $5 durability. I had a $20 pair of cheapos from Payless that lasted 6 months. For what these cost, one would expect a lot more of a life span. Absolutely horrible, complete waste of money."
"My job requires me to walk about 7 miles a day. I love these Clark's because they are lightweight and have the perfect amount of cushioned support. The first time I wore them I didn't like them, because the toe box was tight and rubbed a blister on the top of my foot. I stopped wearing them until my blister healed, and next time I put them on, wow, they were perfect. Once you get the leather stretched the shoe forms around your foot perfectly. The shoes do make a slight ""squishing"" sound as you walk, but you soon don't mind because it feels like you're walking on air. I love, love, love these shoes."
"La scatola è originale  la scarpa e dura non è morbida come dovrebbe o preferito fare un reso . Uso adidas e le conosco bene sono morbide e confortevoli ,questa scarpa ha una suola dura per niente confortevole anche se  la deve usare un bambino. Anche se al piede del mio bambino calza piccola."
son bonitas pero debéis saber que son de puro material sintético (nada de piel en ningún lado) y además justas.a ver que duran pero no se como adidas hace zapatillas con material tan pobre
Buon prodotto come nello standard Adidas!
"ich habe diese Schuhe in einer anderen Farbe auch schon und ich musste sie mir nochmal bestellen!! sind super bequem, schlicht und schön"
Muy rápido ha llegado. Tal cual la foto. Medida justa justa.
Igual que la foto
Demaciado pequeño
Scarpe ottime per pioggia eleganti e comode. Ho sostituito le mie vecchie Swims dopo 7 anni
"Die Schuhe selbst sind ok, sehr leicht. Die Sohle hat einen rutschigen Eindruck vermittelt, ob es sich draussen bestätigt hätte, kann ich nicht sagen, da ich sie zurück geschickt habe. Sie fallen kleiner aus und sind auch etwas eng geschnitten.  Schade, das hätte man angeben müssen."
Super leichte und bequeme Schuhe :) Farbe wie abgebildet.  Schon mei 2. Paar :)
Bequeme leichte Schuhe! Ich mag sie sehr !!
The only thing I liked about these shoes was the color.  For slip on shoes they were a struggle to get on.  The soles were the kind you find on inexpesive shoes.  I was expecting a lot of cushion but it has a very thin cushion.
"These shoes are so cute and comfy, but the back comes up really high and rubs/cuts into the back of my heel.  I had to return them."
I really like this shoes. Extra thick support.
"Liked fit, color. Ordered a pair for $15.which is amazing but when I went to order a second pair, now $42."
"All day comfort in this breathable, light weight foot wear."
very comfortable!
I didn't receive the correct shoe
Mir persönlich sind die Schuhe hinten an der Ferse zu hart und ich habe mir gleich eine Blase gelaufen. Aber sie sind sehr schick und man kann sie zu allem tragen.
Ich bin begeistert. Der Schuh sieht toll aus und läuft sich super. Bis jetzt kam nur positives Feedback. Alle finden den Schuh sehr schick.
Top Schuhe für den Preis.Halten sehr gut und passen auch auf einen breiten Fuß.Größe stimmt überein.
Im erstem Moment schön und bequem aber schon nach dem ersten Tag bei der Arbeit war klar dass die Schuhe weder für Fußwege noch zum stehen geeignet sind.Gekauft am primeday im Juni und6 Wochen später ist das memoryfoam Fußbett durch und die Sohle ist gebrochen.Ich bin echt enttäuscht
Der Schuh in Größe 38 zu kurz und zu eng für mich.Geht leider wieder zurück.
Sehr schöner Schuh leider aber zu eng :-( ging daher retour
"Optisch super schöner Schuh, leider in gewohnter Schuhgröße zu klein.Ging leider zurück"
"Normalerweise trage ich 37,5/38 trotzdem fällt der Schuh echt klein aus. Naja Glück für meine Tochter der passen Sie, sonst wären Sie zurück gegangen! Trotzdem ein sehr schöner Schuh!!"
Super !!!
Super schöner Schuh für die bevorstehenden schönen Tage.
"Great news, sizing is as expected. Purchased normal U.S. dance shoe size. I wear size U.S. (woman's) 9 in street shoes and typically purchase 8 or 8.5 in dance shoes. Bought these in 8.5. For the most control when dancing, dance shoes are supposed to be just a tiny bit shorter than your foot-no overage. I bought them as an inexpensive practice shoe for the summer months. I dance at weekly outdoor salsa event and that dance suface is not the smooth hardwood one of a studio and can be brutal on shoes. I didnt want to ruin a new pair of $100+ dance shoes that way. Plus heat makes my feet swell, especially when I'm active which sizes me out of my winter practice shoes- remember what I said about sizing: should be no extra room in a well-fitting dance shoe. Interestingly I bought these after deciding to never purchase dance shoes on the internet again. The fit for dance shoes is so particular to your foot and the model shoe/brand you purchase, or at least thats been my experience. I've had only mediocre success with dance shoes I've purchased online. Sadly there are very few places locally where I can try on and purchase ballroom dance shoes. One is over 30 miles away, another has unpredictable hours and the owner rarely answers calls, or responds to VM. The studios where I dance have small collections, but not a lot of size variety so as much as I didn't want to purchase dance shoes online again, I was out of options. I was looking for a wide (stable), low heeled shoe that was very open in the front. I wanted enough material/straps to keep my foot stable, but little to rub on my foot and cause blisters. The peep-toe shoes with the small holes in the front have caused rubbing and blisters to my big toe in the past. My foot will always slide to the front of the (peep-toe) shoe and the place where it 'peeks' out of the hole in the front of the shoe, it rubs during dancing. These shoes do not rub or cause me blisters. They are stable and cushioned much more than I expected. They actually feel a bit plush and ' bouncy' because of the cushioning in the sole of the shoe, which I liked. The clasp is awesome because it allows you to choose the tightness of your strap and once you lock that in with the buckle, you only have to slide the buckle piece in and out of the clasp making getting in and out of the shoe quick and easy. One of the earlier reviewers of this shoe wasn't aware that design is intentional and thought her shoe was broken.The fastening straps of the shoe can be cut if they are too long. I haven't cut mine, but I did punch some additional holes in the straps so they would be tight enough on the top of my foot. All this is normal when dialing in your personal fit in a dance shoe. I'm very happy to say they've suited the purpose I bought them for and are holding up well in the month or so I've been using them. I haven't gotten blisters with these shoes rubbing my foot in the wrong way. Yay! Best internet dance shoe purchase to-date. I can finally lay-off using the leukatape I'd started wrapping my feet/toes with in my other dance shoes. Long nights of social dancing usually meant blisters. All-in-all, I'm very pleased with this relatively inexpensive shoe. It is inexpensive, but not cheap. Also, they may not be show-stoppers, but they are pretty enough, and most importantly, comfortable practice shoes, which means I can dance longer and happier! The mesh is holding up well too. Oh, they also came with an inexpensive dust bag-perfect for carrying to practice or to socials. If it helps, my foot is: average width, flat, narrow heel. If you will be using this for ballroom dance and have a very narrow foot, I think this shoe may be too wide for you. Average to slightly wider feet (across the the forefoot) will likely fit this shoe best."
"The media could not be loaded.
                




   It's exactly what I am looking for. The size is fitted as expected and the heel is medium. It is suitable for daily wear and also it is good for a dance. I like it very much! The shoelace is very fun and attractive."
"Shoe is true to size. I wear a 7 and that’s what I ordered. Had straps adjusted at my local shoe repair shop and these shoes fit like a charm.  I was concerned that 2.5 inches might be a bit high but they are the perfect height for salsa & bachata. They are comfortable and I don’t experience any pain, even after dancing for 2 hours."
"I ordered these shoes after trying out 3"" ""pimp/disco"" style platforms. The big issues with platform shoes were 1) they were made in every other size, and my size apparently falls right in between, and 2) they are very heavy.The primary reason to get these shoes was to get extra height as one of my dance partners is same height as me barefoot, and she wears heels. I also wear these shoes to practice different posture for balance and to just mess around.Comfort: these are decently comfortable. I don't mind wearing them but I find them less comfortable once I stop dancing and start standing around. My impression is I need a wider toe box compared to what some shoes offer and these seem to be fine in this regard.For reference, i usually wear men's size 10 and these shoes in size 12 fit me well.I do find that it is more difficult to lead in these shoes compared to standard men's ballroom dance shoes, in part because the leader must absorb the follower's energy and this is easier with wider soles, and because leader's spins are often quicker than follower's spins/turns which again demands better balance from the leader."
"This shoe was really great! It fit perfectly and I love the strap that keeps my narrow heel in the shoe compared to others. They look really good on my feet. They blistered my two end toes, but for a cheaper shoe they are comfortable, so I put moleskin on the outer edge where it rubbed and that helped. My right foot is significantly bigger than my left and both shoes fit suitably.  In heels I’m almost a whole size smaller so I ordered a 9 1/2 which is perfect. The only thing that’s off is the plastic heel layer is very slippery on the dance floor and it makes it hard to put full weight on one foot when dancing. I’ve ordered heel grips, hoping they do the trick. Hope this helps!"
"I got these shoes for my daughter in middle school who is taking a social dance class. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on them because it's only a one-semester class, and she is not going to need them after that. These seemed like a good deal, so I carefully measured her feet and used the sizing chart to order a size 6.5--even though she wears between a size 8-9  street shoe. Her feet are a little on the wide side, but not wide enough that she can't wear 'regular' (non-wide width or 'B' width) shoes. When these shoes came, they were size 7 (not the 6.5 I ordered), but it didn't even matter because the shoes were several sizes too small. She could cram her feet into them after several minutes of struggling, but it was easy to see that the straps dug into her skin and her toes were off the edge. I sent them back. I wanted to order a size 8, but the style she had to have for her class (brown color and 2.5-inch heel) was not available (sold out/backordered). I didn't have time to order something else from Amazon (even with 2-day shipping) and wait for it to be delivered, so I ended up going to a local dance store and spending A LOT more money on something that she could try on that was approved for her class. She also needed heel guards, which were easy to find at the local store, but almost impossible to try to determine the right size and shape for this dance shoe on Amazon. Anyone who sells dance shoes should also sell heel guards to fit them. I would have loved to have gotten these in a size 8--I think they would have worked and been a good shoe for what we needed at a good price."
I took these today to a salsa class and these are super comfortable. I was surprised that I’ve ordered my regular size and these are tiny bit smaller that I would expect. Color is pretty neutral/gold tone.
"These shoes are lovely, and I can dance for hours without blisters or aching feet. Best features: Easy buckle clasp and fantastic soft soles that glide across the floor. Bravo!"
"I wear a size 6 and the size 6 fits just fine.  The strap came way too long, but I easily cut it with scissors at same angle.  The tightest hole left the strap way too loose, so I also ordered from Amazon a 2mm watch band hole punch.  The shoes held up very well while doing fast dances like the swing and the hustle.  The shoes appear to be well made."
I started taking Argentine Tango classes so needed a dance shoe with a bit of a heel and more thickness in the heel (than a stilletto heel). This fits the bill perfectly. I do have wide feet and the toe box is very comfortable.. Really like the shoe alot.
Great pair of shoes!
"Those shoes are cute and comfortable. However there is definitely an issue with the zippers. They are often stuck and it takes time and patience to make them go up or down properly. Very frustrating. I'm not sure if both zippers on the shoes are mean to be functional or decorative but you need to unzipp at least one per shoe to put your foot in (and remove the shoes as well). Better not be in a rush when putting them on. Bummer because otherwise I was happy with the comfort, the fit and design ;-("
"The shoes are great quality. Run a little bigger I think but I am affraid size smaller might be too small... so I keep it anyways. I was not familiar with this brand but they are very well maide, leather in and out. Very pleased. I tried many brands some are very well known like SM and this is much better than most on the market."
"These sneaker booties are exactly what I was looking for! Due to other reviews of tightness, I bought a 1/2 larger and they’re perfect! I agree the arch support isn’t as good as some others but it’s ok. I am very happy with my purchase!"
The hightop is a little stiff as it is leather - but this may soften in time. Otherwise these are a good fit and also look good. Will be perfect for wet days too.
I love the combination of a sneaker and a boot. These are something that I can wear year round.  I ordered my usual size and they fit fine. That are cute and comfy and I get compliments on them.
Cute but not the best quality. Not super comfortable and after having them for a month the sole wore out at the bottom and is broken. Bad quality. I’ve only worn them maybe 10 times.
Disappointed in the quality of the boots. They look cheaply made.Returned them and waiting for the refund.
"This a great brand for my foot, discover while shopping at Nordstrom."
Nothing to dislike - these shoes are awesome!  I’ve gotten a ton of compliments on them.  They fit perfect and are very comfortable.
"Ottimo venditore.... arrivata la scatola in ottime condizioni, provando mi sono resa conto che il numero era troppo piccolo.... ho richiesto subito il cambio e nemmeno in una settimana, arrivate le scarpe .... provate.... e numero giusto questa volta!!!!  Grazie mille!!!!"
"Ottimo prodotto. Unica pecca è la parte interna della linguetta che irrita la pelle , basterebbe un bordo rifinito."
Prezzo ottimo
Sono davvero bellissime e comodissime! Vi consiglio un numero in più. Tessuto leggero. Per l'estate vanno benissimo!
"This is mainly a sizing review. The actual product seems good, but cannot comment on its performance since they will need to be returned due to sizing. My husband typically wears size 9-9.5US and after reading some of the reviews suggesting to get 1-2 full sizes down, bought a size 8. This ended up being a touch too small as his toes touch the ends of the shoes. To be fair, this would be big for a size 8, but going down 1-1.5 sizes seems too small. From his experience, these shoes seem true to size or just a bit big. He would suggest to go with your regular size, or to size down 0.5 if you're in between sizes. It did feel quite good except for the sizing, so he'll be getting another pair in a size 9."
"It is autumn now, so I purchased them for the next season.  Trying them out around the house, they feel pretty comfortable.  I'm looking forward to using them on long hikes on hot days.I purchased 10. I typically buy 10."
J'ai une paire comme celles-ci qui date de plusieurs années. Elles sont toujours en bonne condition mais le Nubuck devenait impossible à nettoyer. Je les garde donc pour des sorties de tous les jours. Le confort est parfait et la pointure aussi. Un très bon produit.
"Super roomy, your toes have plenty of space to spread out naturally in the sho, making them ideal for longer adventures.The strap could be a little uncomfortable for some- mine sit on top of a bone, and can feel abrasive after a long use. Because the foot is so roomy, I need to keep the strap a little tighter to keep them feeling nice and secure.Would recommend despite these issues! Great in water and on trails!"
"Same thing happened to me. After I wore them three times, I lost maybe a dozen orange grips.  And I cannot have a replacement since they are out of stock. Never had a problem with Merrell...knock off????????"
Me dio mucha pena tener que devolverlas porque son estupendas  Tallan grande. Al menos necesitaría un número y medio menos.El vendedor muy formal con la devolución. Tuve que pagar los gastos de envío y comunicar la devolución del correo pero por su parte fueron serios y cumplieron muy bien. Recomendable.
"I have same shoe in the grey/blue size 8 1/2 & perfect fit so I ordered same size in the black, when I put on they were ways too wide & longer so much that they slipped when walked ??  I was forced to return the black/grey pair."
"Like all sport shoes by Merrell, those are excellent too."
Confortables mais un peu grands
This is the 2nd pair of these shoes and I love them. Comfort & durability.
"These are super cute and appear well made. However, I'm a true 6 but read the other reviews and ordered the 6.5 just in case. Not only are the shoes too small, but I legitimately cannot even get my foot inside them! These are labelled ""6.5"" but they are clearly no bigger than a 5.5, maybe even a 5. If you must buy these, order at LEAST a size up, if not more - but honestly I would not recommend buying them at all, because if they can't get something as simple as the shoe size right, I would be surprised if the actual construction of the shoe held up."
The fit is perfect and they are so comfortable and sturdy. But the look - they looked even better than the picture. When they came I had to wear them right away and I think I may live in them!
"I bought these as a Black Friday deal, best shoe I’ve bought in awhile. Fit exactly how I expected (I usually only wear adidas so if you’re used to adidas sizes and know your size it’s perfect) and supports my feet while I work. Super comfy, highly recommend!"
Very good quality.
These shoes are very comfortable but just after a few days I started noticing the green color fading off and the white cloth underneath coming through which made the shoes very spotted and looking very odd.  More and more keeps fading off each day.  I am very disappointed especially because they are not inexpensive shoes.
"I wanted to love these soooo bad because they are so stinking cute!!! BUT as hard as I tried they just were not comfortable to me. Standing in them for 2 minutes and my feet would just hurt. The footbed was too hard. I even bought a wonderfully thin soft memory foam insert (so the shoe didn’t fit too tight and I ended up keeping the insoles because I loved them) but I found no relief. I had such high hopes for these from the amazing reviews, but I had to send them back. They were true to fit. They weren’t narrow (and I have wide feet- so that says a lot) and the length was fine. They were just hard and made my feet sore. But many other people I know love them. Hope you have luck with them!!"
"Came brand new in adidas shoe box. They’re super cute! I ordered an 8. They fit comfortably but if you like a bit of extra space between your toes & the end of the shoe, id say to order a 1/2 size larger than usual. These will make great nursing shoes. Very comfortable to walk in."
"I have purchased and returned many pairs of black sneakers over the past several months (thanks Amazon Prime) because all my usual brands (Puma, Asics, Reebok) have either changed in sizing or quality. I usually wear size 8.5 to 9 in sneakers and got an 8.5 in these based on reviews. The fit of these Adidas are exactly proportioned to my feet: wide at the toe box for my mild bunions; close-fitting and supportive at the arches for my flat feet; and narrow at the ankle to keep from slipping. The fabric is cool and stretchy without feeling cheap, but I will have to wear a different, more water-resistant pair for rainy days. I also like the subtle black-on-black print, black sole, and wide laces. Finally, a keeper!"
"These are my 2nd pair I've bought. The newer Edge Lux are made from recyclable materials, and were so tight that they hurt. They were so cute on, but I couldnt get past the way they felt. I found these shoes online since I cannot find them in stores anymore, and they are exactly like the ones I bought last year at my local sporting goods store.I am a size 7, and they fit like they should. I wear them to work as a nurse, and would wear them daily doing everything from yardwork to working out to amusment parks. They don't rub my skin when my socks are too low, and they dont hurt my feet. Now, they don't have thick pads of comfort, or a thick pad to walk on like some other brands, but I didnt want that. I would not recommend using these shoes to run or jog for exercise because they arent supportive enough for that. These are lightweight, and do not look bulky so that I can wear them with leggings and shorts without feeling like I have heavy looking shoes on.They are better than mesh because they feel like sock material over your feet. I love that because I dont like to have sweaty feet when I wear my shoes all day."
"This is now my 8th pair of these as I have most of the colors.  Why so many- because it is the most comfortable sneaker on earth and versatile enough for working out, running errands and even wearing to work- hence why so many colors.I have arthritis in both knees, Achilles tendinitis in both feet, and am a life long flat footed person- I put on these sneakers and I feel like my feet are on air.  I over pronate  when I walk, which worsens my knee pain, but in these, my foot is well supported allowing me to walk briskly, without pain.This rose gold color is now my favorite color!"
Wunderschön vielen Dank.
Super gibt nichts besseres
My regular size is a 9 in shoes. I ordered an 8.5 and they were still too big. I returned them but they didn’t have a sz 8.
Great pair of shoes. Great for walking
"I love them, fit great and looks exactly as pictured. 100% what I expected . I did read reviews and decided to get HALF SIZE DOWN. I'm usually a size 9 I got size 8.5. Fit perfectly , little extra room so I could wear with socks. Awesome sneakers for people with wide feet & so comfortable. Recommend 100%  👌"
"This is my 4th pair of these shoes in different colors, so obviously I love them! Having said that, I know that they run 1/2 size to 1 whole size too big. I generally wear an 8 or 8 1/2 in sneakers and I order a 7 1/2 in these."
The are way too wide and don't look as nice in person as they do in the picture I dunno what Ima do with them
"These Adidas are amazing! After having had gone through a few pairs of shoes (Nikes, to be honest) to find an ""athleisure"" based sneaker to walk in comfortably all day, these shoes did not disappoint. Below are the highlights of pros and advisories of this sneaker:Pros-comfortable- like seriously, they are very comfortable. I am a fitness instructor that is on my feet majority of the day and wear these on a daily basis. They are great for walking and long periods of standing.-light padded support that hugs your foot and provides support for long periods of standing and walking.-moisture proof-the material in the shoes will not cause your feet to sweat.Advisories-Run a little big. I am a size 7 1/2 and ordered a size 7 and they fit perfectly.-Do not recommend these sneakers to exercise. These are not running nor training shoes. I wear them to walk and long periods of standing, but never for high impact nor agility based exercises."
"I have narrow feet and these fit fine for me. They are super cute and nice looking shoes. I probably wouldn't wear them to the gym, but I took them with me to Hawaii and wore them on the plane. Adidas is a brand to size down in because they normally run large, so if you have a pair of Adidas already, order that same size. They're not as soft as some other Adidas, and have a bit of a harder base to them, but like I said, I got them more for looks and an everyday shoe. I would recommend them!"
"The fit is really great. I am a size 8 and I bought a 7.5. It never squeezes me except for the annoying band under the lace and it affects mostly my left ankle constantly. No matter how I try to fix it, it always digs into my skin. The picture is dead on, and what you see is what you get. I wish the laces were not that thick because they do not keep tied for long. For comfort i would say a 7.5 out of 10."
These are super cute and stylish.  I love the unique off white greenish color.  I have a very big wide foot and its super hard to find shoes.  These run big and wide … which works for me.  I usually wear a 10.5-11 and I got these in a 10 and they fit great.
"This shoe is soooo big! Style is cute, just soooo big. It felt like more then one shoe size big."
"Update: went on a 10 km hike today. They were great: great support, comfortable, still look like new. These are very comfortable! I was leery of ordering my actual size because I wanted to wear socks in them. But then I didn’t want to go a size up because the price was way more. But they fit perfect with socks. Also they are really cute and well-made. Wearing them on a hike this weekend, so if there’s any changes, I’ll let you know ;)"
"Seams are cheaply glued, but I'm going to give these a shot since Merrell has never really let me down. I can hardly believe they'd put their name on something that really doesn't seem sturdy or waterproof. To be safe I went over the (already clearly separating) seams with Aquaseal, will update review after this Canadian winter."
"J’ai porté mes bottes une seule fois et j’ai beaucoup aimé le fait qu’elles sont légères et chaudes. Elles pourraient être très confortables mais je dois dire qu’après une longue marche, le derrière de mes chevilles en a souffert, juste au-dessus des talons (pas de simples ampoules, la peau a arraché et ça saigne!). Je n’ose plus les porter, du moins tant que ça n’aura pas guéri. Je marche beaucoup et à bonne vitesse; je cherchais des bottes légères et confortables. Je vais tenter de trouver une solution mais je suis un peu déçue car je croyais que Merrell = confort."
"These are super soft leather, very cushioned...great geal and ankle support and super light...I think they are as light as running shoes...not sure how they did that!  Love them!"
"OMG THESE ARE SO FREAKEN LIGHT! like a feather. came in mint condition. some scratches. had paper fillers/stuffing THANK GOD <3they do fit just slightly loose at the tip because of the ""m"" sizing. but other then that. wow! you can feel the grip, anti slip on these beautiful shoes!! the waterproof part i don't know. haven't used em yet in such terrain. BUT Thank you sooo much amazon!!! got them at an AMAZING deal <3 WOOOO! THANK YOU!"
"the cushion of the shoes is just awesome. I think that Merrell is always delivering that quality cushion that I didn't see in other shoes. I used the shoes for probably a month, while I really like them, I couldn't give a 5 stars rating as I feel they missed the waterproof part of the product. sometimes,  I am getting some water from the leather, even when it's not heavy rain. other than this, I ordered the usual size I am ordering from any other brand and they fit as expected"
"Bought these for $51 on sale here at Amazon, beautiful shoes for the price , now they are back to 200 bucks. Nice soft leather , I added some thin inner soles as they are approximately 1/2 a size to big. I got lots of Merrells and they always have the same size . Great shoe for $51."
"I love these boots!!!! These were a steak at $100. Super comfortable, no break in time needed. I took them hiking in the woods after the rain and the mud was easy to rinse off. I would recommend spraying first, though. Merrell products are consistently fantastic!"
Bought these to travel to Europe two years ago.  I still have them and they are holding up very well.  Will be ordering another pair of Merrill boots when needed.  Highly recommended.
"I love the boots and would recommend. I was diagnosed with heel spur, planter phasitus and arthritis these are comfortable and I don’t have to use orthodox. Quality is good too. I got them on sale so that’s even better."
"Auf der Suche nach bequemen Sneakern, sind mir diese von ""Hummel"" in die Augen gesprungen. Bezüglich der Optik sind Geschmäcker bekanntlich verschieden, ich persönlich finde sie aber sehr schön und stylisch.Schuhe im Internet zu bestellen ist immer so eine Sache für sich. Oftmals passen sie nicht richtig oder irgendwie drückt es. Deshalb war ich anfangs auch skeptisch - bis ich sie das erste Mal getragen habe. Ich bin perfekt in die Schuhe hineingerutscht, sie haben perfekt gepasst, waren extrem bequem und ich habe mich direkt darin wohl gefühlt. So bequeme Schuhe habe ich wirklich vorher noch nie getragen.Ein großer Nachteil an den Schuhen ist natürlich, dass sie sehr schnell dreckig werden, wenn man nicht aufpasst aber darauf lässt man sich ein, wenn man weiße Stoffschuhe kauft. Daher kann dies schlecht ein Kritikpunkt sein.Ich kann nur eine klare Kaufempfehlung aussprechen!"
"Schneller Versand. Den Schuh habe ich eine Nummer größer genommen und es war richtig so. Für superschmale Füße wohl nicht so geeignet (oder dann dicke Socken anziehen). Bitte immer mit Schuhanzieher anziehen, damit der Stoff nicht ausleiert. Für den Angebotspreis durchaus ein ansprechender Schuh. Von mir eine klare Kaufempfehlung."
"Me sorprendieron,mejor de lo esperado,las he adquirido a muy buen precio.son cómodas y muy ventiladas,la suela es buena con amortiguacion neutra y es de las que parece que duran,son lijeras."
"Tra le scarpe più comode che io abbia mai comprato. Non saranno esteticamente eccelse, ma, per quanto concerne la comodità, a mio avviso, sono formidabili. Consigliate!!"
"Der Schuh war wie beschrieben und bietet einen hohen Tragekomfort. Die Firma Hummel sollte mehr auf sich aufmerksam machen! Die Lieferverfolgung war vorbildlich und der Versand kam vor dem angegebenen Termin. Alles in allem, Super."
"Me han encantado. Son comodisimos, bonitos y con un precio espectacular. Tengo deportivas mucho más caras y me resultan más incómodas para andar"
Absolut knallige auffällige Farbe kommt echt gut rüber ansonsten auch alles  andere top
"An der Qualität gibt's nix zu bemängeln, wie von HugoBoss gewohnt. Für meine - vergleichsweise - schmalen Füße ist er etwas zu breit und geht leider retour."
"Le scarpe sono comodissime anche per stare tutto il giorno in piedi a lavorare, le consiglio."
"sehr schöner, eleganter Steamer. Weiches Leder und dadurch ein angenehmes Tragegefühl."
Comode e per solo 10 euro top
Bin unzufrieden
Correcto.
Weihnachtsgeschenk für meinen Mann. Volltreffer!
Alles prima

"See DanGeorge review it is accurate .... plus after 2days of wearing the Reebok printed label started wear off! The sole of the shoe is so thin you can feel a pebble ...... very unhappy with the supplier and with Amazon for promoting this garbage!!!!!!  And now I am out almost $130.00.  THANK YOU AMAZON!Follow-Up 05/28/21 Went to the Reebok Outlook Mall Store they told me this shoe model # is not one of theirs shoes.....I tried to make them work for a week.  They were so uncomfortable to wear I bought insoles to try to make them comfortable didn't work....after 1 day of wearing the shoes the Reebok logo printd inside the shoe was wearing away.......oh! While I was at the Reebok Store I purchased a great pair of Reebok's, very very comfortable and for only $73.00"
"Bought these in January, in April, the leather on the right shoe started to bubble. In May the left shoe outer seam ripped. I'm not doing any real activity in these, just walking - I think around 5k steps a day. This isn't the quality I remember from Reebok."
Bought for my son for work as he is on his feet all day. Great so far
El producto es de piel sintética por lo que carece de la calidad esperada. Por favor no lo publiquen así porque engañan al cliente y lo hacen dudar o convencerse de que la próxima compra volverá a ser engañado.
Good thing
Very sturdy but comfortable shoe. I have worn them for a full day on several occasions with total comfort.
Incredibly comfortable and stylish. Great shoes!
はけないことはないが，ＵＳサイズと基準が違うようだ。
"I read reviews to help in purchase decisions. So I hope this review helps you. In a shoe store using gauge I have a men's 10-1/2 D (regular width foot) actual size.  I buy size 11- Wide in everything I buy,Skechers,work boots etc.I like to ensure room for expansion and insert foot beds if needed. I bought sof sole gel insoles here on Amazon also.These arrived today, I ordered 11 X-W  They showed on order as 11 4E {?} Length is good,width is slightly snug with or without replacement insoles. If you truly have a wide foot,good luck. Otherwise the insoles are tacky stuck down but are removable,inserts make a big difference. Quality is good,bright white,look nice and yes I would recommend"
"These are fire I love them! I was scared when ordering these because they’re so cheap - less than $30 I thought they wouldn’t be authentic or made out of plastic. These are authentic, the box was in good condition all labels were on. They feel great when I put them on and I don’t see any signs of them being fake. Even have memory foam type material at the bottom feels good. I have been looking for some nice casual white leather shoes and these slap! I get mad compliments. I’m buying all these colors and will post the results. I would say that they are slightlyyyy narrow just a little. So if you have fat feet that may effect you. I didn’t let that effect the rating cause I don’t have that problem. Ima do some walking in them if they hurt my feet or somethin I’ll let y’all know."
"J’ai toujours aimé les Reebok et je devais m’en procurer de nouvelles pour y ajouter des orthèses, actuellement on ne retrouve que des chaussures foncées et je voulais des blanches, alors j’ai ce que je désirais!"
"I looked at a lot of reviews and took heed to going up a size. I have fat feet and I wear a size 10. I got the sneakers in a 10.5 and was a great choice. The sneakers are very comfortable and since I went up a half a size, I have room for my feet to grow. I love the royal blue. I love the sneakers. I haven't worn the shoes yet so I will let you know if anything changes. The shoes look just like the picture...the sneakers are too cute!! I can wear them with jeans, shorts or basically anything.***Update******I have worn the shoes and they are so comfortable. I love to wear them with jeans or shorts. These shoes match with just about everything I wear when it's blue. The shoes are on the more dark blue side. I love my old school Reeboks. I am glad I made the purchase for these sneakers. Do go up a half a size, especially with fat feet like mines..lol. Lovin' my shoes."
"Sometimes, you look and search for the perfect sneaker, well I have purchased many pairs of sneaker throughout my 70 years and these and so perfect, so comfortable, and not one area of this  shoe did I feel discomfort or a pinch.I just wanted a nice pair of sneakers to wear with jeans and they're perfect.Love the feel, they are very softlove the color, its a very subtle blueI am extremely please with this purchase and will definitely buy these again. I know I will purchase a white pair, when my present white ones die.Wonderful purchase and will buy again."
These are not the Reebok princess shoe you fondly remember.  They’re not leather.  They are stiff and very narrow and don’t let your feet breathe at all.  A big disappointment!
"The shoes are amazing but if you are ordering regular fit meaning not wide please order one size bigger. I ordered a 7M and when I try the shoes it feel like it was a 5M. I had to returned the shoes and I lost $ 8.18 in the whole process, I guess in shipping and restocking."
"The shoe is stiff and hard and ran a bit on the small side for me. It squeezed my feet together and after a few hours, my feet was hurting."
"I purchased this pair of shoes to replace this exact brand & style shoe.  I have needed to replace the insole with a thinker one that has a better arch & a bit more cushion.  Otherwise, these shoes fit as my previous Reebok’s did. I wear these as Winter shoes.  Our winters are fairly mild here in Texas, so this type of shoe works well.  The black color works well with most jeans/slacks."
"These are affordable and comfortable so they're like my house shoes for running errands.  They are simple so they will match a simple outfit or a jazzed up outfit.  You always need a black pair of black shoes and these are easy to clean.  When they start to looking to rough, I just order another pair maybe every 8 months."
"I was a able to order these on Amazon because we own other Reebok Classics and we know how they fit.  But if this is your first time buying, I would recommend trying them on in a store if you can.  They look super cool, but they tend to run quite narrow.  I have wide feet so I have to order at least one size up."
"these shoes have changed, i've been buying these for years and they always fit great.  this pair is very snug.  i've only tried them on i havent worn them anywhere so maybe they will stretch out a little bit.  i'm hoping so.  but just trying them on it was hurting my toes so when i do where them the first time it will probably only be around the house to see if i can stretch them a little.  it says these are wide but they dont feel like it."
"Son muy bonitos, super cómodos, excelente calidad en materiales y confección"
Excellent shoe. Looks great. Fits true
Good quality
"I love everything about these shoes, they're comfortable, cute, and very lightweight. The only problem I have is that it runs about a 1/2 size larger. I'm normally a 9 or 9 1/2 but I think I could have sized down to an 8 1/2 on these."
"I expected these to be too narrow, but it turns out the leather is soft enough to accommodate my medium (borderline wide) width feet.  I ordered my normal size and the length is perfect.  The footbed is somewhat cushy, though I may need to use inserts as I have high arches and PF.  I haven’t worn them out yet.  I think, no-show socks for all-day wear would work best with these shoes to avoid getting blisters where the seams meet.  I love the simple and low profile design.UPDATE:  Unfortunately, after wearing them twice I decided to donate them.  My feet must’ve grown wider from gaining extra weight since covid.  A shame, because they really are cute."
"These are cute, and I like the style. I was disappointed that they didn't have the arch support that I would have expected from the Clarks brand. Not sure if I will be keeping them. They are comfortable otherwise."
Pinches at the toes
super comfortable. White color. run a bit large. I bought a half size smaller and they fit great.
"I have a pair of these Clarks sneakers in the black leather and liked them for work so I bought these in the color that was left: rose.  Doesn't really go with my wardrobe, but suede is dyeable.  I dyed them with a dark red which, over the medium pink, produced a burgundy.  Nice.  Because suede dye doesn't truly take on synthetic fabrics, I tried to avoid the lining and I replaced the laces with a closer match.  Overall, a fun DIY upgrade.  And Clarks are a great brand I can count on for quality shoes that last well for me."
"I am very disappointed. I had heard how great Clarks were and was excited to get these at such a bargain. I now know why they were on clearance. I wore this shoe around the house for a short time and they felt ok but, wow, towards the end of my work day my feet started killing me. They hurt on both sides as well as across the top. Sending back ASAP!"
"Ho ordinato un 38, mi è arrivato un 22. Da notare che, nell'annuncio, le misure partivano dal 24... non si sa quel 22 da dove sia uscito. Peccato perché erano carine."
"Realmente bonitos, y se adivinan de calidad. Lástima que haya pedido un 38 y me haya llegado un 22..."
Pedí una talla 38 y me llegó una 22 de bebé... eran bonitas pero no lo que yo necesitaba. Devolución fácil por parte de Amazon.
Con el uso habitual de un niño se estropea rápidamente. Se despega la puntera. A los pocos días y después de unos días de cole y parque... parece que tienen meses.Tenemos otras de la misma marca y otro modelo que dan mucho mejor resultado.
"Las playeras son bonitas, pero son duras, las suelas no son flexibles. Parecen no ser tan cómodas. Las he comprado para mi bebé de 2 años, una talla 24, una más de la q lleva normalmente. El no se queja, pero igual es pq las lleva un poco grandes... comparando estas con las que tiene mi hijo de puma y adidas, las rebook me parecen bastante malas, al menos este modelo que le he comprado. No volvería a comprarlas."
"PECCATO PERCHE' LE SCARPE ,CHE DOVEVO REGALARE AL MIO NIPOTINO,ERANO BELLEMI E' STATA CONSEGNATA UNA TAGLIA DIVERSA DA QUELLA CHE AVEVO ORDINATO"
"Le ho rese, numero sbagliato...ho ricevuto il rimborso"
Quedan bien. Incluso diría que tallan un poco pequeñas.
"molto carine, taglia ok."
Eran para regalo y vinieron con la caja fatal..... Ya no tenia tiempo para devolverlo si no por la caja que vino en ese estado la hubiese devueltoPor el resto las bambas muy monas y cómodas para el peque
Die Fußballschuhe für meinen Sohn sind super angekommen. Farbe ist eher pink als rot 😉
Tallaje europeo perfecto. Materiales buenos
色がカッコ良かった。息子も大喜びしてました。
"Have you ever had a great fitting glove? I have, and these shoes remind me of a comfy glove that holds my feet with the right amount if support. I didnt want to like  these because they are more pricy than I was willing to pay. But they had everything I was looking for, black, white sole with a lot of grip but not to high, and waterproof! And the style is more oxford than sneaker. I needed it for work because Im always on my feet, and they look a bit more profesh. I cant wait to put them back on tomorrow!"
"people buy thing based on the pictures, i asked for replacement and i dont think i am going to get the one on the pic item for the second time"
"Liebe Leser,wir haben die Schuhe für unseren Sohn gekauft, weil er unbedingt grüne Bergschuhe haben wollte und da ist die Auswahl dann doch nicht so groß... Auf den ersten Online-Blick hat die Qualität für den angebotenen Preis gepasst, aber auf der ersten Wanderung, wo es uns eingeregnet hat und der Sohnemann zuhause die Schuhe ausgezogen hat, waren sie voll von rosarotem Pappmaché. Als wir die Sohle zum Trocknen herausgenommen haben mussten wir feststellen, dass in den Spritzgusssohlen die quaderförmigen Zwischenräume mit Pappmaché gefüllt waren, welches sich bei der eingedrungenen Nässe aufgelöst hatte und sich im ganzen Schuh verteilt hatte. Keine Dämpfung, kein Fußbett - nichts außer nassem Pappmaché. Also komplett wertlos und Schade ums Geld - mal schauen, wie sich der Verkäufer beim After Sales Service verhält, um zumindest den einen Stern sich zu verdienen den man geben muss, oder eventuell bei ordentlicher Rückabwicklung einen Zweiten dazuverdient."
"Zunächst einmal das Gute am Schuh. Er passt wie angegeben und sitzt recht gut.Nun leider zu  negativen, unter der Einlegesohle befindet sich nur etwas Pappe,  die sich sehr schnell auflöst und die Sohle darunter Preis gibt. Diese tritt sich dann recht schnell durch und das bereits nach 3 Wochen. Die angedeutete Gummierung außen ist nur hauchdünn und für Kinder nicht geeignet, da die Schuhe sich extrem schnell abnutzen. Nach 5 Wochen nur noch ein Fall für den Müll da unser Kind sich sonst die Füße kaputt macht und das obwohl die Schuhe nur im wechsel getragen wurden"
"Habe die Schuhe für meine 7jährige Tochter gekauft, Ende Mai bestellt- Versand wie von Amazon gewöhnt problemlos! Aber qualitativ bin ich enttäuscht...am 23.5 die Schuhe bekommen und nun Mitte August sind sie total kaputt! vorne offen und total ausgelatscht!!meine Tochter hat auch noch andere Schuhe sprich sie wurden nicht jeden Tag getragen!ich erwarte von Outdoor Schuhen defenitiv mehr!!"
"Vorab: unser Sohn liebt die Schuhe. Da man sie zuziehen kann und es seine ersten ohne Klettverschluss sind. Er kann noch keine Schuhe binden, findet sich selbst aber zu groß für Klettverschlüsse.Ich bin nicht ganz so begeistert. Wir haben die Schuhe jeden Tag für den Kindergarten / die Vorschule an und nach 4 Wochen lösen sie sich nun leider auf. Sie lassen sich recht gut reinigen, so dass sie auch nach einem Tag im Sandkasten wieder passabel aussehen.Ganz dumm aber finde ich die Sohle! Die Innensohle aus Stoff kann man raus nehmen, sie ist sehr dünn und lapprig. Drunter befindet sich eine Sohle aus Pappe (!!!). Die ist fest im Schuh. Mein Sohn schwitzt an den Füßen (in diesen Schuhen umso mehr, denn atmungsaktiv sind sie beileibe nicht) und die Pappe wellt sich nun im Schuh.Daher kann das Laufen in den Schuhen nicht bequem sein. Er mag sie nur wegen der Optik, zumindest gehe ich davon aus.Ich bin ganz froh, dass sie sich nun auflösen und ich andere kaufen kann. Denn mit solcher Schnürung gibt es auch andere Marken."
"Beim ersten Anprobieren waren wir begeistert. Die Schuhe passten, mein Sohn machte vor Freude fast Purzelbäume. Sie waren SO bequem und der Grip grandios.Dann stand die erste Wanderung mit den neuen Tretern an. Ich wunderte mich, nach 4-5 Kilometern war er nur noch am quengeln, weil die Füße weh taten. Wir wandern viel und gerne. Das war uncharakteristisch.Bei unserer großen Pause am Mittag, nahm ich die Einlegsohle heraus, damit die vollgeschwitzten Schuhe besser trocknen, und fand sofort die Ursache für die Schmerzen. Die Schuhe sind offensichtlich mit Pappe ausgepolstert. Diese hat sich im Laufe der Wanderung so komprimiert, dass die im Bild sichtbaren Rillen durchgedrückt sind. Dass das beim Laufen wehtut ist klar!Ich hoffe bei der Erstattung klappt alles. Das geht nämlich gar nicht. Als Wander-, oder wie beschrieben gar Trekking-Schuh, völlig unbrauchbar. Und das auch noch für einen Preis, für den man in Kindergrößen auch vernünftige Trekking(!)-Schuhe bekommt."
"Diese Schuhe als Trekking-Schuhe für Kinder anzubieten ist unverschämt.Nach wenigen Wochen Tragen löst sich die untere Papp-Innensohle komplett auf und zerbröselt in alle Bestandteile. (siehe auch Fotos von den anderen Kommentatoren hier). Noch dazu kommt, dass vom Fuß ausgehende Feuchtigkeit (was Füße nunmal mitunter so an sich haben), sammelt sich hervorragend zwischen den beiden Sohlen. Das führt dazu, dass man die Schuhe nicht mehr tragen kann, da die zweite innensohle viel zu dünn ist und alles durchdrückt.Die Schuhe haben 31€ gekostet und sind nach einigen Wochen nicht mehr tragbar. Ich würde sie auf keinen Fall wieder kaufen."
"Der Schuh wurde nur 3x mal Sonntags für den Sport von einem 11 Jährigen getragen. Danach reif für die Mülltonne.Dazu kommt noch dass einmal der Schuh in dieser zeit auch getauscht wurde ...... Material ist nicht zu empfehlen , optisch ein sehr schöner Schuh in unseren Augen"
"Nichtmal 1 Stern wert!Ich habe wirklich in 7 Jahren, die ich meinem Sohn Schuhe kaufe noch niemals solch einen schlechten Schuh besessen.Nach gerade einmal 1 Woche riss bereits die Klettlasche am Gummizipper ab, da dachte ich noch: okey Kind hat blöde dran gezogen.Nach 2 Wochen waren die Sohlen schon stark abgelaufen und vorne die Schuhkappen massiv abgeschubbt und ich fragte meinen Sohn, was er denn neuerdings beim laufen so treibe.Nachdem jetzt aber nach 7 Wochen der ganze Schuh auseinander fällt, Löcher in die Sohle gelaufen sind und ich gedacht habe ich fall vom Stuhl, als ich die Einlegesohle herausgenommen habe, muss ich meinem Unmut doch mal Luft machen. Dieser Schuh hat die Bezeichnung TREKKINGSCHUH in keinster Weise verdient und nichtmal 8,-€ Schuhe aus bekannten Discountern haben so eine unterirdisch schlechte Qualität wie dieser Schuh. Es grenzt schon an Frechheit solch einen Schuh in den Verkauf zu geben und auch noch als Kinderschuh. Geschenkt ist noch zu teuer!"
"Wir kaufen schon seit längerer Zeit die Schuhe von Lico. Sie sind robust, sitzen gut und sind einfach für die Kleinen zu bedienen. Bis dato hatte mein Kleiner noch keinen Stinkefuß, die Innensohle kann man entnehmen und den kleinen Sandkasten darunter einfach leeren. Die Schuhe sind auch für breite Füße geeignet, dank des Gummizugs. Bitte genau die Schuhgröße bestellen, die euren Kleinen haben. Er fällt normal aus.Allerdings hatte ich bei dieser Bestellung das Problem, dass sich an der ""Zunge"" beider Schuhe die seitliche Naht schon stellenweise gelöst hatte. Allerdings zwar noch nicht so, dass sie gleich auseinander fällt, nur war hier die Verarbeitung nicht gut. Man muss aber auch sagen, dass wir bestimmt schon 10 Paar von denen bestellt haben..."
"Die Schuhe sehen schön und gut verarbeitet aus, allerdings ist beim ersten Mal Tragen eine der Schlaufen kaputt gewesen, in die das Gummischuhband gefädelt ist. Ich glaube nicht, dass die Schlaufe ausgerissen ist, sondern dass sie eher nicht mit genäht worden ist oder zu knapp abgeschnitten. Selbst reparieren wäre hier nicht möglich gewesen, Amazon hat sich allerdings vorbildlich in Bezug auf die Gewährleistung gezeigt und somit konnten wir die Schuhe zurückgeben und andere bestellen.Von der Passform her waren sie ziemlich eng und relativ steif, keine Ahnung ob sich das nach längerem Tragen legt."
"Nachdem mein eigener Schuh nach 6 Monaten gebrochen war, ist der Schuh für meine Frau auch defekt.D.h. er ist nun undicht...leider etwas schwierig auf den Bildern zu sehen.Die Sohle ist ohne Fehler und die Passform spitze und daher ist es extrem Schade um den Schuh.Wie kann so eine miese Qualität durch die Qualitätssicherung kommen?"
"Das Obermaterial ist nicht wirklich haltbar. Bei beiden Schuhen ist auf beiden Seiten das Material gebrochen und nun ist der Schuh natürlich undicht. GTX hilft dann auch nicht mehr weiter.Es ist besonders bedauerlich, da die sonstigen Eigenschaft wie Passform, Tragekomfort hervorragend sind."
Hervorragender Trailrun-Schuh. Mittlerweile das dritte Paar dieses Typs.
Alles super
"Scarpe comperate come regalo per un mio nipotino di 8 anni. Provate, usate, nipote soddisfattissimo. Non posso dire che con quelle scarpe possa diventare un campione, ma, secondo un vecchio proverbio "" il buongiorno si vede dal mattino "".  Orlando"
Le scarpe sono di un marchio che investe molto (come Nike) nella ricerca ed il risultato si vede. Ottomo dedign e ottima calzabilitá...e mio figlio è contento.
Calidad precio buena
"Las zapatillas Adidas doradas, le han encantado a mi hijo, súper cómodas e idénticas a las fotos. Estamos super satisfechos"
"Prodotto come nella descrizione, arrivato nei tempi. Mio figlio è molto contento anche sr poi ho trovato qualcosa di meno costoso identico in un negozio di sport qui vicino."
"Perfette...belle,mio figlio ne va pazzo anche per via del colore...prodotto arrivato perfettamente imballato e con un giorno di anticipo"
"Good quality, easy to get in and out of for a young player in a hurry, especially because of the elasticated neck. Comfortable and practical."
"Son muy ligeras,mi hija encantada con sus botas"
"Todo bien, excepto que las hormas de este modelo son más grandes que de otras botas Adidas que he usado"

Bestimmt ein Super Schuh leider fällt er ziemlich klein aus nur eine halbe Nummer kleiner als in Straßenschuhen bestellt und deutlich zu Klein so dass ein Hinein kommen Unmöglich war.
"Details:Black Diamond did a great job on the build of this shoe and it shows. The attention to detail is excellent. Good mid range shoe. More on the aggresive side but not extreme. Although the way that the shoes molded sole was built makes it an even range shoe. So it does well on overhangs and small foot chips when needed. The sole has a little flex or it can maintain the drop as well.Sizing:Black Diamond typically makes their shoes so you can order them in street shoe sizes. Although there are thousands of different feet variations so choose wisely. As for me, I have a wider foot base, more natural volume to my foot structure and proportionate toe size. So my street shoe size 10.5 is slightly too tight. I originally tried a 10 but that was way to small for my feet. Even considering a little stretch in time there's no way those would fit me. 10.5 was a squeeze for sure a little painful but bearable but I want to climb longer overhang routes so I opted for an 11 so I can wear them longer during sessions. These won't stretch too much because they are synthetic. Also I live in California and when you climb outside in the heat you're feet naturally swell up a bit from the weather and or the approach so they are perfect! That's my two cents. Happy climbing!"
"I got a great deal on these (maybe 50% off) so took a chance on the size,Fits the same ax my converse chuck taylors (no padding so typically have to get a size smaller than traiditional sneakers)Im a 10.5 in converse and 10.5 black diamond fit great - I wear an 11.5 in most sneakers, bootsSnug fit at the toe (comfortable), Heel feels loose as other reviews indicate but not unsecure.- My heel is well anchored and not coming out of the shoe, but the material on the sides around the heel doesnt fit snug, almost like there is too much material front to back on the sides of the shoe; Once you have them on and climbing that looseness concern goes away; As I mentioned the toe and heel are very secureHighly recommend them - been out 4 times and am impressed so far"
"Awful, they hurt my feet! I thought once they were broken in they would feel better but nothing has changed. Others have tried them & agree that they kill the feet."
I’m a size ten and bought size eleven but my toes were curled so much there was no way I could wear them. Great looking shoe otherwise.
"Very aggressive which I wanted, I got mine half a size down from my street size and they were a little difficult to get on at first but just get in them, break them in in a couple sessions and you’ll be good. But don’t plan on walking around all day in them, definitely meant for one problem at a time, or single pitch at a time, but yeah great aggressive shoes."
Fits well once broken in. I have owned Black Diamond climbing shoes before and these fit just as good as the old ones. Same size too.
Oh boy these are aggressive but they are sweet. Size runs a bit funny thus the 4 start otherwise 5s stars easy
"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The shoes came in used Black Diamond you got to be kidding me! Returning item."
"They look great and feel strurdy but, I haven't been able to try them. I normally wear 9.5 tennis shoe. I ordered a size 10 and they are still too small. I will rerate when I get an exchange"
Dancing
"ich habe mir den Schuh im Juni 2021 gekauft.Jetzt, Ende September, fängt der Schuh an sich an der Seite aufzulösen.Ich habe den Schuh 2x die Woche an und das auf noralem Rasen...Mann könnte ja davon ausgehen, dass er wenigstens 6 Monate halten würde.Ich würde gerne wissen wie lange der Schuh bei öfterem Gebrauch hält.. 2 Wochen?Danke, aber nein danke.Grüße."
Passt
"Although I like the slip on style with laces, there is absolutely no support in these shoes."
"This is a really nice casual shoe. The laces are really only for decoration as the shoe doesn’t have a tongue or big opening - it’s more like a nice wooden sock you slide your foot into. Anyway, it’s comfy, fits really well (for my wide-ish foot) and looks nice. I’m very happy with them."
"The most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. Lightweight, soft, giving, yet you can tighten the support straps as needed. Immediately we ordered more of them for the future before they are discontinued."
"I love these shoes! The wool makes them warmer for the winter, and the support allows me to wear them all day. I usually wear and 8 or 8.5. I went with the 8 with these, and they fit perfect! Highly recommend!"
"I got this to replace the moc all around town as they no longer have the color and size I need. I love this shoe. I usually wear 7.5 but exchanged for 7, runs a little big. Easy to put on, and i loved the ""fake"" shoe laces, can't tell it's a slip on!!!!"
"I already adore Merrell shoes, so loving these wasn’t a surprise. The wool upper lacks a bit of support, but I more than makes up for it in breatheability. Perfect for warm weather. SO comfortable!"
I was very happy about these shoes at first...until the inside seam split after a few days of trying them out indoors.
"The ‘M’s on the side of the shoe is not leather, but almost felt and it ripped when I tied the shoe."
"I used them for work, they are pretty comfy but not for 10 hour days."
Very warm and comfortable. Can walk for miles in them.
甲高な自分には少々キツめ。柔らかいので履けなくはない。フィット感を考えたら逆に脱げなくて良いかも？ワンサイズ上げて注文すれば良かったかな？
"I have a high arch. So getting these on is a task. Once on, they hurt my arches even after I'd taken them off. I wish this was not a problem cuz they are nice shoes. Just a word of warning to high arch people, not gonna be good."
"Could not fit my foot into the shoe. This shoe might be good for you if you have a very narrow foot and ankle. The shoe tongue is attached all the way up the sides so you can't adjust the fit, if that makes sense. And you have to pay for return shipping, which is my fault bc I didn't read the fine print."
Got these for cheap and I see why. They are unwearable.
"Fit is true to size, not as springy as Cloudfoam or Alphabounce series that I’ve worn previously. There is not a separate tongue, so it’s a bit of an effort to get on with my high arch. For the single 5K run 🏃🏻 they were good, no slip or movement inside the shoe 👟 and no rubbing so no blisters. 👍🏻"
Nice shoe that fit fairly true to size once I managed to get them on.  The opening to these shoes is too small making it very difficult and painful getting my foot down into them.  For that reason I have to return them.  Sad because the price was right!
"These shoes woul be comfortable but the fit is awkwardly small. They are too short in length, and narrow in width but still look wide and bulky. I have a normal to narrow foot width and always wear a size 12"
"I have brought before, hard to get the right color, good fit , you are going to need to get arch supports if you have low arches. they sold out and no idea when or if you can buy more."
"I wear a size 9.5 and when they came, they fit good from front to rear and side to side.  But they are very tight from bottom to top.  The top of my feet hurt from wearng them the first time.  Hopefully they will break in and loosen up a little."
Looks awesome. Just like the picture.
Hermosos a mi hija le encantaron vienen un poco amplios pero están cómodos y muy bonitos se enamoró de ellos
"They are kind of like the cheap ""made in china"" shoes you would find at the dollar store. You know, made for people with square feet, no support and they only feel good if tied very tight. I can't imagine these are actually ""adidas"" shoes."
"Son hermosos, buen material pero la talla es mucho más grande, no viene en tallas mexicanas"
"Sneaker came in perfect condition, absolutely new. Shipping was within 2 days via Amazon Prime.Sneaker fits true to size. I would recommend buying the same size as your Stan Smiths/ Jordan 1 size."
"Llegó antes de lo esperado y en excelentes condiciones de empaque , el producto cumplió totalmente !!! Por experiencia sabemos que el calzado viene más amplio"
"Great looking shoes though I haven't gone anywhere yet -saving them for when we get liberated from the Covid 19 lockdowns and mask wearing. Gives one something to look forward to-like we used to say back in the day - I'll look ""fly"""
"Están preciosos, pero demasiado grandes. Tuve que cambiarlos"
"My son wears a size 1 currently in both his pairs of adidas shoes. So we ordered a size 2 in these. They are barely any bigger then the size 1s... im talking like maybe half a cm bigger. Really nice shoes, look great but just too small in sizing."
"El tenis es perfecto, solo que si no tienen las tallas solicitadas seria bueno que preguntaran si aun asi queremos el producto, ya que solicite 13 y me mandaron 14.5saludos"
"Fake Adidas, glue on the sides, box was all crushed. If it was real Adidas, they would provide an extra pair of laces. They are REALLY cheap. Good looking, but CHEAP and FAKE."
Contento
My son loves these shoes I did buy no tie laces for them but they are easy for him to get one and off.
"La talla no es la correcta pero están hermosos, son perfectos tal cual la imagen"
Bon produit
Las tallas son dos cms mas grandes que lo que marcan
Good quality shoe my son loves it
"These are absolutely adorable! We never buy our toddler expensive shoes, but these were too cute to pass up. On the first night she wore them she dropped chocolate cake all over them. I was freaking out. When we got home I took the insoles out (they slide right out nice and easy!) and put them in the washing machine on cold and a low spin. SPARKLING WHITE AGAIN! Woo! I love a good pair of washable toddler shoes! Heck yes!"
"Sehr schön, aber nicht besonders bequem."
"Okay shoe, super cute, but very hard to put on no adjustable shoe laces they are elastic and built-in shoe.... in my opinion they run kind of big I returned them for a smaller size both sizes were hard to put on took up a lot of time trying to get these on for school.... I would have liked them better if they were adjustable and I could tie them myself but it is great that they are elastic because they will never come loose at school but like I said very hard to put on...."
"They are the perfect ""dress"" runner for my son."
Wir haben die Schuhe für unseren Sohn bestellt. Sie sind sehr weich und angenehm zu tragen - absolute Kaufempfehlung! Sie laufen sich wie Barfußschuhe mit einer sehr beweglichen und weichen Gummisohle. Das grasgrün ist eine wirklich tolle Sache Farbe und wir haben sie gleich Gecko Schuhe getauft :-)
"Top Schuhe, sehr bequem, mein Sohn trägt sie sehr gern und sie passen ihm auch trotz ziemlich schmaler Füße hervorragend. Die Sohle ist extrem flexibel und sie sind selbst bei sehr hoher Beanspruchung (Klettern etc.) noch gut in Schuss."
"Super Schuhe, weiche Sohle, fallen ähnlich wie die von Filii aus, nur preislich günstiger. Lieferung ohne Probleme."
"Sehr weiche Sohle, sehr flexibel, schönes Leder und gute Passform"
"Auf der Seite Lurchi.de Grössentabelle heruntergeladen und Füße ausgemessen. Schuhe passen perfekt,top Qualität, weiche,biegsame Sohle, tolle Farbe. Mein Sohn trägt sie von Anfang an gerne"
"Tolles weiches Leder, großartige Farbe, super Preis, leider für einen Barfußschuh zu schmal, wirklich sehr schade!"
Fällt sehr groß aus
Top Qualität
Todo ok.
Very comfortable. Very stylish. Fit is proper to the size.
Muy bonitos de color y todo pero están muy angostos y me quedaron muy chicos
"Excelente llegó antes de lo esperado, muy buen precio, cumplieron todas las expectativas"
"I never write reviews but thought this was worth cautioning. I ordered a size 3, as we had bought a size 2.5 in the store and the shoe didn’t have much room to grow. The store was sold out and this is the only place I have found a 3 in the blue color. You can see in the pictures a comparison of the sole of the new shoe from the store vs the shoe I bought here. The soles of the shoe bought here are filthy and the inside of the shoe has hair and some balled lint from obvious wear. These will be returned, as I thought I was purchasing a new pair of shoes.Also, for sizing reference I would definitely size up a half to full size for your kids."
"After spending upwards of $200 on my 11 year old *picky* son's basketball shoes for the last 3-4 years from brands like Nike and Under Armor, I decided to give Adidas a try. What a pleasant surprise :o These shoes are great looking, feels extremely well made, and best of all it found a place on my son's Instagram page (he is picky about his social image, you parents will know what I mean). Happy dad highly recommends :)"
my daughter is 11 and wears a size 7 in women's we bought a size 5.5. i have to fighter her not to color on them
"A very narrow fit. I was surprised because I had never been disappointed with an Adidas shoe purchase for my son. I wonder if the narrow sizing it is due to the ""unisex"" make of the shoe...?"
"My son LOVES these sneakers.  They are his favorite color, super comfortable, and all-around a great shoe.  He never complains about them hurting his feet and the color is so vibrant!  We will be buying another pair now in the next size up because they are hard to find."
I would recommend a half to whole size up.  They are also a bit narrow on his foot however his foot is a little wide.
"I am very upset with this company. I had to spend $15 to ship my return back to them and I also find out I'm going to be charged a 15% restock fee? For the price of the shoes I didn't expect to have to pay return shipping at all. By the time I am through I will have spent almost half the cost of the shoes just to send them back, I have never had a company double charge me like this to even think about reading the return policy. Obviously I will in the future but I think it's wrong for this company to have such a high restock fee and charge for return shipping for a product that cost $75. This is ridiculous, am very very upset about this and will NEVER order from them again!! The shoe is terrible quality and the material is harsh and uncomfortable. You can see the glue along the fabric where it meets the sole. Very upset!"
One of the shoes showed that it had been worn for more than just to try on. They also have THE HARDEST SOLES. It honestly sounded like I was walking around my house in high heels. NOT COMFORTABLE AT ALL. I am so disappointed because these are so cute. But in my opinion these shoes are definately not worth the money. Sent back.
"These are cute, but just not comfortable. They also run very large and wide. I am a size 6 and they fit more like a 7.  They're very hard and the soles are not comfortable. Labeling them as a ""running"" shoe is misleading. These would probably hurt my feet walking around town all day, so being labeled a running shoe is inaccurate.  I chose to return.  Also, you must pay to return shipping + there is a restocking fee.  Disappointed."
"Great look and style, however they run really large. I usually wear 8.5 or 9, these I had to get an 8 and they are still large in the heel area. I'm going to keep them because they look so cute but the sizing is really off."
Great item strongly recommend it to anyone the way the item is present it is the way it works perfectly
"The shoe is really cute, which drew me in. However, the sole is incredibly hard and the shoe is too stiff to get on even though the size ended up being too big. What I strongly hated about this is the seller not only makes you pay for return shipping (not unheard of), but there is also a restocking fee. Buy at your own risk."
"I think they fit a little big , which is odd cus adidas for me always fits just right! But I still like them! I have been wearing them since I received them."
"i wear men's 9.5, maybe 10i purchased woman's size 11 (should be a 9 in men's). shoe fits me a perfect, a little bit more room than expected for a ""men's 9"" but i like the fit.shoe is nice, i took it and twisted and contorted as much as i could to break em in. sole is hard af, but it will break in it seems like. i almost want to cut the middle strap off -- i probably will."
"Great shoe! I was a little surprised, because when I got the shoes I noticed grayish/silver/gold speckles on the rim of the shoe (which you can kind of notice in the pictures), I still really like the shoe. Only downside for me was the fit. It fit perfectly in length, but in fit in the actual shoe was not very impressed. I have a pretty narrow foot so one of the shoe's elastic fit perfectly the other shoe's elastic was very big on me. Not quite sure the reason, but I still really loved the shoe. Another thing (which I really didn't mind, but others might) was the sole and bottom of the shoe is NOT flexible at all really. It is very hard and makes a noise when ever I walk. I do not mind this at all, but others might especially when buying a 100 dollar shoe. It got to my house fairly quickly and I was pleased when it arrived. Over all I really enjoy this shoe. It definitely is more of a fashion statement than a practical working shoe, but I really love it! Definitely would recommend!"
I took the advice of other who had bought the shoes and ordered a half size smaller. They fit perfectly.  These shoes are noticeably adorable.  I plan to wear them casually and not as a training shoe.
Son preciosos y la calidad perfecta. El color es también genial. Perfectos para verano.
Muy cómodas. La horma un poco ancha
Muy comodas
"Good fit, good quality and comfortable. Would recommend."
Ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo!
È come lo volevo.
Très bien adaptation aux pieds dits sensibles pour la marche. Idéal également pour la conduite.
Parfait...
"prodotto perfettamente rispettoso delle aspettative, il numero e' esattamente lo stesso, e il colore e' identico a quello in foto. molto belle e comode, mia figlia e' entusiasta. arrivate addirittura in anticipo sulla data di consegna."
mauvaise description du vendeur sinon belle chaussure quant on a la bonne taille en bon daim je les conseille elle sont presentable
"Il prodotto è come me lo aspettavo, la misura è perfetta, arrivato nei tempi dichiarati, molto soddisfatto"
"Si tienes niños en edad escolar este es tu calzado perfecto para no arruinarte y que vayan a la última, incluso para hacer deporte específico de atletismo.Como dijo Jack, vamos por partes. En primer lugar hablaremos de este calzado como el típico modelo genérico, con suela de goma apta para todo tipo de terrenos. Bien cosida a la horma, ésta se caracteriza por ser de material sintético consistente, lo que no le resta comodidad. La bamba en sí se ve muy cómoda y así me lo ha hecho saber mi hijo al probársela.Viene con unas plantillas interesantes que se extraen con facilidad si llevas plantillas de podólogo, como es el caso, o quieres alargarles la vida un poquito más cuando le crezca el pie a tu hipoteca andante.En el tema de la estética es donde personalmente encuentro mis mayores reticencias, pero el precio es tan ajustado, que para un niño que todavía no es ni preadolescente, nos podemos permitir ese lujo asiático de no volvernos locos con lo molón. Así que, mi hijo tan contento con sus ""bambas para destrozar en el cole"". Que oye, tampoco son tan feas y el negro pega con todo. Además son Puma, una marca de reconocido prestigio. Así que a quejarse al Parlamento, que seguro que hay más motivos✅- Precio.- Marca.- Específicas para correr.❌- Diseño (va a gustos).- Durabilidad si juegan a fútbol.En definitiva, una compra aceptable para el día a día de tus herederos, que si quieren que les quede algo, mejor que te ahorres en calzado de batalla."
"La calidad es muy buena y son muy bonitas. No le doy las 5 estrellas porque el tallaje viene un poco pequeña, pero parecen duraderas y de calidad."
"Poco resistenti, purtroppo dopo 1 settimana mia figlia le ha gia consumate.. secondo me non sono originali, non è possibile!"
"Lindas, qualidade muito boa e fácil de calçar, uma compra recomendável"
"Toller leichter Schuh, nicht nur für Innen, mein Sohn liebt Ihn"
Lovely pair. A definite buy
"Se las compre para mi hijo y está encantado, son muy cómodas"
"El color es igual que la que está en la publicación, mi hija me comenta, que son muy cómodos, el color le encantó a mí esposa! El precio se me iso accesible."
"Ein super leichter, schicker Sneaker für jeden Tag! Meine Tochter war sofort in love und sagte: ""Mama, behalten!!!"""
"Prima Kinderturnschuhe, die passen und auch richtig gut intensiver Beanspruchung standhalten."
"These shoes didn’t fit and when I tried to return them I realized I would have to pay for return shipping. It’s my fault for not noticing this, but I wouldn’t have bought them if I knew it didn’t include free returns."
This is the second pair I have purchased.  I did so because I was so pleased with the first pair.  They are very comfortable for walking or working out on a treadmill.  Highly recommend.  Great value for the price.
"They are awesome shoes but if you have a wide foot like me, then I recommend getting the wide version! You'll thank me for it lolI'm an Amazon delivery driver. I run thru shoes quickly. These are great except they are a bit tight on my wide foot. I bought the wide version and good Lord they feel Amazing!"
I would not recommend this one.... Mine was torn within few months ...it's not for hard use and training although it says so... The heels wear off do quickly and mine the toe area is already torn...so used only for few months.. definitely not worth the money I guess....
Walking
"Shoes are a bit narrow at first, but once they were broken in, they fit like a dream."
"I was debating getting these shoes. After much back and forth with my self I decided to get them, and am I glad I did.1. They fit true to size2. They are super comfortable, light and stretchy3.  They came with little white ankle stockings....bonus4. They are not bad looking on at allThese are not supportive at all, eventhough I bought them primarily for the gym. I wouldn't do any type of high intensity activity in them. I don't think they would hold up under the pressure.I would definitely purchase another color, and I would definitely recommend these."
"Very comfortable. This is an attractive, comfortable walking shoe for summer.  They are mesh and would probably not do for cold or wet weather but they are great for warm and dry.  I have a small foot and athletic type shoe usually make my feet look likes Minnie Mouse's. |These are slim and weightless and look great. I've had many complements on them."
"These cute, lightweight sneakers are like wearing comfy slippers!  They don't have great support so I would not recommend using them for running or aerobics but I've been wearing them all day around the house and I have zero complaints!  If you wear them outside I would wait till warm weather as they are not waterproof nor do they insulate in any way.  Understand what you are purchasing-these are fashionable, comfy, casual shoes.  Not high-performance sneakers.  Fit true to size.  Am a 7.5, ordered a 7.5 and they fit perfectly.  I love these so much I have purchased 2 more pairs in different colours!  Great shoes for the price!"
"Just arrived (so cannot speak to durability yet), and I'm thrilled with these shoes!  They are incredibly comfortable, no sore spots or discomfort and the arch support is fantastic.  I was debating whether to buy these or the Dr. Scholl's Madison walking shoe.  I went with these because they were less expensive, boy am I glad I did!  They are super breathable and comfortable which is just what I need for an upcoming trip to NYC."
"I have Type 2 diabetes and my feet get very tender and hot in regular sneakers and they swell if I walk for a long time, these seem like they are going to be good for the first problem since they are very ventilated as for the feet swelling they are pretty stretchy so we'll see. I can't test them outside for now because it's winter and there is a lot of snow, but I wore them all day yesterday in the house and they were very comfy.The sockette that come with them have a seem down the middle so they are unusable for me because the seem irritate the sole of my feet."
I love wearing these for shopping trips because they feel so comfortable and very lightweight.
"It is definitely light, true to size and seems comfortable. However I had to return the pair because the soles are very narrow/slender compare to the typical brands i’m use to wearing."
Comfortable for a few months. But now loose on top of shoe. The elastic is not strong enough. Not anywhere near as comfortable as Sketchers.
I really like these shoes.  They offer more support than sandals.  They do run a wide.
Very comfy for walking at home. My wife was heavily pregnant when I bought these for her and her feet were swollen.she felt very comfortable walking in these for long distances.
"I deal with a lot of swelling in my feet, and neuropathic pain as well. This is my second pair of Dr. Comfort's and they have pluses and minuses over the previous pair.Pluses:Extra ""depth"" to the shoe - Most of the swelling I have is on the top of my feet, with a little less to the sides. Having this extra depth keeps my foot from feeling mooshed into the shoe, putting extra pressure on the swollen areas.Velco Straps/Tongue design - Someone actually did a little engineering here. Instead of a regular flapper of a tongue this shoe has no tongue but a separation to the side of the shoe that opens wide, allowing a lot easier access to get one's foot into the shoe without having to yank the things on over your feet. The straps make adjusting the amount of pressure to hold the foot in place highly adjustable.Minuses:Inserts - Although these come  with very high quality inserts, they aren't as comfortable as my original Dr. Comforts. Not as well padded and not as good arch support. It probably would never be noticeable though if I hadn't had the first pair to compare.Inner Padding - The insides of my originals were soft as lamb's wool. While these are fairly comfortable, they are the level of cooshiness I've come to expect.The minuses are relative though. Compared to other shoes on the market, if you suffer from issues with your feet, these are a heck of a lot kinder to your tootsies than any ""normal"" shoe you will find. Overall I am quite pleased with this purchase."
I wear these shoes because I use AFOs (in shoe braces) on both legs.  I also have a hip problem and have trouble tying my shoes.  These work great.  This is my second pair.  The others are black/grey.  I got these white ones for summer.  The extra wide are really wide and work perfect for me.  They come with spacers to adjust shoe depth.
"I'm a type 1 diabetic. As I age, I've found it difficult to buy comfortable shoes. I had high hopes for these until I tried them on. There is virtually no padding in them and arch support is inferior. For the price, I expected much more. They're also huge. My feet rattled around inside even when I used my orthotics. Quality is not as good as I'd expected."
"Ugly but not horrible, fit pretty good, comfortable.Update: Still like them but 3 months in and some of the tread is peeling off. Glued it back on.Update: 5 months in and the interior is crumbling. Heel is worn out and some plastic thing is poking me around the heel. Top layer of insoles is shredding. It's just the fabric part of it but it makes it uncomfortable to wear because I feel fabric lumps under my feet. I was able to fix it by gluing on some inexpensive thin insoles. But for the price the shoe should have lasted longer."
These shoes are wonderful for my special needs son who wears AFO braces on both legs. These shoes go on easy and come off easy because of the extra shoe depth and wide open access to the shoe. No more struggling and fighting to apply the shoes over the braces. It's a breeze.
"For several yrs I have been trying to get my husband to try Dr. Comfort diabetic shoes. I have been wearing Dr. Comfort shoes for 4 yrs. I love the support and comfort plus the styles of my shoes.  Finally,  his podiatrist recommended Dr. Comfort diabetic shoes and he came right home and ordered. A day after receiving his shoes he said, ""Why didn't I ever buy these shoes for him in the past!""  I just shook my head, no use telling him that these are the shoes I've been talking to him about for years. He loves his new shoes and said he doesn't want any other shoes from now on. This is onehard-headed guy who knows a quality product when he feels one! Way to go Dr. Comfort!!!"
This is the 2nd time that I have written about problems with this shoe. The first time was because the Velcro straps on my left shoe were uneven. So I wrote to the Dr. Comfort company and Never received a reply from them at all. (Great Customer Service)Now the sole on my left shoe has come unglued and is not safe to walk with because the rubber on the sole keeps rolling up when walkingwhich is very dangerous for me (Great Workmanship) I belong to a stroke club with about 300 members and I will definitely tell them to steer clear of the Dr. Comfort shoes because they are a $150 ripoff that did not last 2 months without falling apart.
"These were great for several months, but recently, my husband was driving our truck, hauling our 43 ft 5 th wheel trailer,er and the shoes had stretched so much that his shoe fell off while driving and got stuck under the brake pedal, nearly causing a very serious accident. Thankfully we have a hand trailer brake he was able to use. We tried tightening these with the Velcro as far as possible but the shoe still slipped off. Is 5 months the average length of use for wear. If so, these are very expensive for the length we have had them."
Shoes seem excellent quality; sturdy and supportive and well made. Unfortunately the width runs a bit small. A small block inserted in the toe showed the width just over 1/2 inch narrower than 2 other brands. My toes were painfully cramped and walking was uncomfortable. The issue was only with the toe; otherwise the shoe seemed comfortable. If toe width is important this is probably not your best choice. If that is not a major issue however this seems to be an excellent option. Unfortunately I returned mine.
"I have too many foot problems to talk about ,so lets just say these are the only shoes I wear now. Finally a shoe that is both wide and deep enough to deal with it all. They were comfortable new and as they break in they are getting even better. The included inserts were sized correctly and as far as the quality goes, they pass the test so I don't believe durability to become an issue down the road. I now use ""shoe leather express"" more than my car lol."
"Ok so I’ve run in the wave creations for 13 years and this update is very disappointing. First off it’s much heavier than previous models, maybe that means more cushioning and can be used for longer runs idk.  I don’t feel it has the same arch support and it bothers my shins slightly.  The toe box is smaller and it feels like my toe bang up against the medial side of the shoe.  This could be the shoe just runs smaller and I need a bigger size? Either way my feet are extremely narrow so I usually never have a problem with a narrow toe box.  It does not have a tongue which I actually love. It slides on so easily and feels like it fits great but then I start running... I thought it would the same as my other Mizunos but I’m frustrated I may have to find myself a new running shoe.  Overall I’m going to give it another week and see if I can “break it in” a bit, although I have never needed to do this with previous versions."
"I am a sneakerhead, having over 100 pairs in my collection. Not only do I want to run in something comfortable, but I’m also about the colors. These are no plain Jane  shoes. They sparkle with color. Like something in the ocean, a nice blue-green color scheme. Did I mention comfort and fit?  My size 11 footsies are happy. Ran five miles so far, and no issues. Mizuno makes great shows!"
"First of all, I’m a size 6.5 in almost every normally sized shoe/sneaker/sandal etc. The sizing of this sneaker (and another Mizuno style of running shoe that I tried on in-store) is completely wonky! I started by ordering my regular size, and it was So Small and Painful. So then ordered a 7, and then a 7.5, and finally an 8(!) before I could put them on my feet without my toes getting smushed up at the front. Unfortunately, in the size that fit me the best, the arch support of the sneaker was positioned in the wrong place, so it was really bothersome and uncomfortable to wear. Also, the material by my ankles rubbed. On the positive side - I can say that the cushioning and the integrated tongue were nice.I bought and returned 4 pairs of the same style of sneaker to Amazon and have nothing to show for it, but a complete lack of confidence in Mizuno sneakers. I’m going to try a different brand. Wish me luck…"
"I've had 20 pairs if wave creation over the years. These look great.  However, my toes keep cramping up. Im not a runner.  Working from home I'm wearing. them all day. I keep wearing them a half day s and switchback to my perfect wave creation 20s.  Please put the toe box back to normal."
"I LOVE the color and style of this shoe! And when I tried them on, they seemed super comfy. Problem is, they run about a half size too small (and they don’t have them the next half size up to exchange…boo). I had seen similar reviews for other Mizuno shoes about sizing, but most reviews of this particular shoe said they fit true to size. I would disagree. This is the second pair of Mizuno‘s I have ordered on Amazon and will return because they’re just too small. Seems as if the sizing of Mizuno has shifted overall, regardless of the style. Order a half size up and my guess is you’ll be very happy!"
"I’m a huge mizuno fan, they have been my choice in running shoe for 10+ years but these are super disappointing. I am a 7 1/2 in regular shoes but always order an 8 or 8 1/2 in mizuno since they tend to run small. Bought an 8 1/2 and they don’t fit at all. The heel padding pushes your foot so far forward your toe is crammed at the front of the toe box. The plastic pieces that the laces attach to are rigid so if you try to tighten the laces to keep your foot back they push into the sides of your foot giving you blisters. This is more than a size issue, it’s an overall fit issue. Unfortunately I missed the return window so have tried to make these work, but there is just no way. Very disappointed!"
"I wear a 9 1/2 Mizuno. At least, I have for the last 10 years. I ordered the Creation Waveknit 2 in a size 9 1/2. They were too small. So, I sent them back and ordered a size 10. I thought it was just me—because how could it possibly be the shoe—and thought if I sucked it up, put on thicker socks, and changed up the lacing that they would work. Nope.  It looks like I’m wearing clown shoes.  Like, they really look that ridiculous. These things actually slip off. And because I tried to make it work like an abusive relationship, I can’t send them back.So if you’re looking for a pair of women’s Creation Waveknit 2 running shoes in a size 10, I have a friend who can cut you a deal."
This is my second purchase and it’s extremely comfortable for working or standing for long durations. This is a well made shoe drained to support the foot not just look pretty. Material allows the toes to move freely and breathe.
"I wanted so badly to love these shoes. I've owned several pair of Mizunos in the past and wore them until they were practically falling apart. These are narrow and small. My foot felt squeezed in, despite being the correct size. I walked around my carpeted home for a few hours. When I took the shoes off, it was a relief. Had to return them :("
This was my 4th pair of Mizuno Wave shoes.  This style of knit shoe is sooooo uncomfortable that I can only wear then a few hours before my feet start to ache.
Awesome. Amazing. I love them!!!Great service
Incredibly uncomfortable as the back of the shoe is high and causing excruciating pain on the back of my foot. Nice style and design.
"The shoes provide excellent grip on frosty parking lot, wet surfaces and light snowy area. I am very glad that I made the right  decision  buying them."
I would never have considered ordering shoes online but haven't been able to find what I need for our slushy days. These fit very well and I usually need to buy footwear from specialty stores. Surp6and pleased.
These are very comfortable and lined so are warm.  They are nice to wear in town when you don’t want to wear a boot.  Good price for a good brand.
I have been looking for winter slip on shoes for a while. I was a little nervous about buying on line as sometimes shoes are not true to size. These are true to size and very comfortable
This are my go to. Second pair..first pair lasted years...they work for Canadian weather. I love them ..
"Love them, a bit stiff at first but breaking in great. Slip on and off quickly, love walking dog in them in winter."
They are warm and waterproof.  They are a bit difficult to get on - I need to use a shoe horn since the elastic on the top is a bit snug.
good arch support and orthotics fit
Great winter shoe. Fits well & keeps your feet warm and dry. This shoe is a must for winter!
love Them .
"Belle, comode, come in fotoHo preso il 37 invece del 36 perché ho la pianta larga e le caviglie grosse, con una soletta di stoffa sono perfette"
"Die Schuhe sind bequem, sehr leicht und super um lange durch trockene Strassen zu gehen. Bei starkem regen werden die Füße doch schnelle nass, aber das ist ja bei den meisten Sneakern oder Sportschuhen so.Ich bin super zufrieden, genau was ich gesucht hatte."
Die Schuhe sehen richtig toll aus und sind dazu super bequem. Hatte es an einem kalten Tag angezogen und es hielt die Füße warm. Ich empfehle es jeden und werde mir aufjedenfall eine andere Farbe zu legen.
excelentes zapatos
"I was surprised by these shoes.  I tried them on and they felt comfortable enough, but didn't seem to have the support of other sneakers I've owned.  I gave them a try going to Universal for two days.  At the end, I was the only one in our group without bad foot pain.  My feet were mildly sore, but nothing compared to what they normally would have been after walking that much."
So very comfortable
very comfortable walking shoes
love these sneakers
Great fit and super comfy.
love them they are super comfortable
"the shoes are a little snug to get on, but once on, they are not tight. had hoped for more arch support, but they do ok. my job requires standing for long periods, these shoes are not going to provide the support and comfort needed. for short term activities they will do fine. sketchers memory foam shoes beats these hands down."
"Son tenis súper cómodos, ya van cuatro pares que compro para regalar y a todos les han encantado por su ligereza y comodidad. No los he utilizado para hacer ejercicio, pero para caminatas son bastante funcionales por la plantilla soft foam."
Excelentes tenis. Los recomiendo
"Perfecto,,, la medida que esperaba"
Le quedaron muy bien y le gustaron mucho
Son lindos tal cual se muestran en la foto
"Putting on and tying shoes…especially when it’s time to go is not one of my daughters favorite things to do.  She absolutely love’s her Puma’s!  They’re not only great looking, but she says they are “LIGHT” and “SUPER COMFY”.  We liked them so much we ordered a 2nd pair in case Amazon runs out of stock.  If you have a chance BUY THESE NOW"
"SUPER cute shoe. Fit as expected & I got them when they were $30 which is about the max I will pay for my sons shoes for the age of 3. I was very satisfied. It is a lighter kind of shoe. These are not leather, heavy duty shoes. My son isn’t very hard on his shoes yet so I didn’t feel like they were a waste not being as heavy duty as I normally buy. They are not poorly made by any means. Just not a pair of shoes you go puddle jumping in."
"You rarely get bad products from this name and this is no exception. Fits great, looks great."
Great shoe but plan for them to be too dirty to wear after one day. Unless you can be sure they aren’t being worn outside they get dirty fast. Also we’re a bit snug compared to the same size in other sneakers. Usually love puma but these ones not so much.
I was looking for some nice white shoes for my son. It works. They fit as expected and are holding up against my five year old and recess. He has even managed to keep them somewhat clean.
En 15 días ha perdido bastante su color original. Dudo que sean originales.
muy buena calidad
"Me encantaron se ven súper y súper cómodos! Fáciles de lavar, quedan acorde a la talla. Definitivamente  Buena compra"
Compré para regalar
Muy suaves!!! Están hermosos
"I had these for walking, its seems NB make sneakers better for people that do a lot of walking. I came across them when i was just browsing thru sneakers and came to these with a low  price, i bought them and stored them as replacement. I prefer the camou version of these shoes but these white color ones will do. Bought them for $27.37, while these can go for as high as $50 plus, so money save."
Me gusto
"Got the greenish grey ones on sale for $25.  For that price, I'm very happy.  They have that spandex inner lining kinda like a sock between the sole and tongue of the shoe but I don't mind it."
"Los zapatos son lindos, confortables y el color es bello. Le doy 3 estrellas porque vino con la parte dorada pelada y no sé si seguirá pelando con el uso. Los pedí talla 10 para un regalo y era el último par."
"Design, and style on a buget, nice to slip on and off with out socks, great for the beach, and a shoe you can just slip on and off, and still look DaD cool in the process, ,LoL"
These where better than I expected. Love them.
Comfortable shoes but they run small. I don’t normally wear a size 12 shoe but it seems like NB shoes run small. Originally had an 11 but that was very snug. Walked all day at an amusement park and my feet felt fine afterwards.
My son loves these New Balance skate shoes!It did take a week or so to break the shoes in because my son has a very high instep and these shoes don't allow alot of instep room
These are soft yet durable and very comfortable on little feet.  Elastic is firmly attached so little ones pulling hard to get their feet in the will not pull the elastic off.  The color is the soft theatrical pink not just regular pastel pink.  The split sole really helps little ones to point their feet nicely.  Much better than the full sole style.
Great skate shoes . My son loves them and the green looks really good in person.
"I used to dance - not professionally, just for the activity - and when I found split sole shoes, I never looked back. They made my arch prettier, they were more comfortable, and I just loved them. So when my 4 year old wanted to take ballet, I wondered if they made them tiny - they do! I got her a pair of 8.5C - a guess on sizing - and they fit perfectly for about 6 months, until she outgrew them. We got her next pair locally, and they don't carry split sole for kids, so she has the traditional style.  Planning ahead, I picked up a 10.5C here for when she outgrows the current pair.  These are good shoes, and they have held up well through three classes a week and a kid who is tough on shoes. They also come with the elastic sewn on, which is nice. Ready-to-wear."
"I like everything about this shoes; however, the only complaint that I have is that the color is starting to fade after 4 months of normal use. Besides that, it is a pretty comfty and good looking product."
"Perfect! We used the Bloch bunnyhop all this time, because well my daughter liked that pink over the standard pink capezio.  Well I'm not fond of Capezio shoes anymore anyway, bunnyhops were out of stock and narrow is hard to find anyway, so we gave these a try.  Super soft as the other Blochs are and now that she's trying these with a split sole, she said they really are a lot easier to be more graceful with her feet with the split in the sole."
These run about 1/2 a size big but we kept the big pair and reordered anyway. She loves the split sole.
not as good as expected. not as sturdy in her toes like the pair we got elsewhere. still cute but cant dance in these for too long
"Really cute, soft shoes. My daughter is 4 1/2 yrs old and wears size 8 in reg shoes. Those shoes are a bit large, but once you tighten them with laces, they fit almost perfect,just a little space for her to grow in them."
My daughter was really excited to get her first pair of ballet slippers with of the cris-cros elastic style. It was a big disappointment when we received the regular one with Just 1 elastic. The photo of this item is not giving the right description.
This is the brand and style required by my daughter's dance team. She finds they are very comfortable and last well until she outgrows them.
No criss cross straps as in photo. Wanted that unique look. Came in just one regular strap across center.
Very cute and they seem comfortable on my daughter for her ballet class.  She loves them.
"This is the first men's boot that I tried (I am female) and am very happy with the purchase. I have the women's version that is worn out but I wanted a boot with a bit more room in the front area due to bunions. They look very similar and are way more comfortable. In comparison the womens version does not have a turned up toe section - not sure why this men's version does but it is nicer when mounting / riding. Better feel in the stirup. Glad I ventured out of the normal comfort zone of boot buying. BTW I take a 9 in wome's, generally a wide."
"I've worn Ariat for years! Having horses they're my go-to boot! When my husband needed a new pair of work boots I convinced him to try something new and ordered these Ariat boots for him.  They got here quickly and when he opened the box he immediately loved the look but when he first attempted to put them on it looked like he was wrestling a bear! However, once they were on he said they are the most comfortable work boot he's ever had and they're surprisingly easy to take off!! He is on his feet a lot and has back problems but these boots have helped especially when you work 12- 14 hour days! Definitely prefers his Ariats (even with wrestling to get them on) over his Red Wings!"
I bought these boots for traveling and right out of the box they were comfortable. Put plenty of miles on these boots and they seem to be holding up very well. Not a whole lot of pictures to judge how they'd look in person but I think they look great!
"These boots look and feel great.  They were true to size in fit.  I have very wide feet so ordered the EE size and they are a little snug for my left foot which is wider, but should break in nicely once I wear them.  The only negative so far is I have a hard time putting them on and taking them off, which I am hoping will get better over time."
"Nice looking, very well made and doesn't have the cheap looking suede strip on the back.  However, I'm grateful to those who said to order a half size down.  I'm an 11 and got a 10.5 and it fits perfectly. I do have a narrow foot so don't know how that plays into it.  Very satisfied."
Wore them 3 times and the stitching started coming out of the toe box - see pic.  Called Ariat....let’s say their service was as good as their stitching on my boots.  Thankfully Amazon knows customer service and covered for them.
These are great boots super comfortable and appear to be high quality. I always wore red wings these are just as nice at half the price. They are pretty stiff I wouldn't recommend pulling the right out of the box and heading to work buy after wearing them for awhile the soften up and feel great on your feet. Thanks Mike
"Nice, light weight, no break in boots. Very comfortable. Holding up well to ten hours a day on concrete. I would recommend these to anyone who isn’t required to wear steel toe boots."
"I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS,  THESE RUN 1/2 SIZE TOO BIG. THE COLOR WAS BEAUTIFUL, THE BOX IT CAME IN WAS BEAT UP. DEFINITELY LOOKED LIKE SOME OLD BOX. THE BOOTS HAD SOME SCRATCHES. I AM RETURNING JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO BIG FOR MY HUSBAND.  I WILL BE ORDERED A SMALLER SIZE."
"Great shoe for casual wear. Well made and very comfortable, I wear mine when we go out to dinner, or just run around town. You could wear these on casual Friday’s at an office, however this is not a work boot, that is not what it is designed for.  I would certainly buy them again."
"Superbe achat ces UGG, de vrais nu-pieds en cuir, à semelle extérieure épaisse et souple à la fois. Le confort de la semelle intérieur en cuvette agrémentée d'une arrête de blocage métatarso-phalangien, sans oublier la qualité de la tige interdigitale offrent un confort inégalé à ce jour pour ce type de sandales simplifiées à l'extrême et d'une légèreté .Indispensables en période estivale: à déguste sans modération, pour assurer la liberté totale des pieds. Merci UGG! Polo83"
einmal getragen und Farbe ab schlechtes qualiät
Gute Verarbeitung. Sieht Wertigkeit aus und ist bequem.
"If you have wide, flat feet you should love these. Runs true to length and very roomy straps. These are hard to find features in any shoe or sandal so that's what I'm focusing on. Fits 4E width in size 14, not sure 6E would work though. The footbed has a super firm, foam type cushion under the leather lining that feels like it will mold to my foot but only time will tell. Made in Vietnam, excellent quality."
Lovely leather fits normally breaks in nice
"Was excited to get these Ugg flip-flops for my brother. Unfortunately, I didn't look at them until the day I gave them to him. They were worn. Rocks in the treead and water stain on the leather soles.  *sighs* should have known something was awry when the shoes came in a plain box instead an Ugg box. Be careful of purchasing shoes on Amazon, could be used."
"The all leather look is classy. But I would advise that if your shoe size is ""something and a half"", go to the next half size up. That way your foot won't hang out over the back of the shoe."
The sole fit my foot exactly so I know I got the right side but there is a MASSIVE gap between the top of my foot and the bottom of the upper “thong” part of the shoe. More than a half inch of a gap is way too much. I have tons of UGG products that I love but this was a huge disappointment. Maybe Australians just have ridiculously thick feet or something?
"The straps are a bit loose, as I expect them to loosen up as they break so I'm returning them. I""m an 11 1/2 and think the 11 would have been better then the 12. The quality looks good but they still weren't for me."
This was a gift for my boyfriend. He loves them. He likes that the shoe contours to his foot. I ordered a 12 which is his size 12 1/2 would have been perfect. He's happy with the they fit.The shoes do not come in an UGG box only downfall.
"Very comfortable shoes. I should’ve listened to other reviews and sized down one but I was worried they wouldn’t fit. They do stretch. Just buy a size down and you won’t regret it. I’ll only wear mine with socks or if I’m just doing a quick errand because I’ll get blisters because of the largeness, they rub to much and cause blisters."
The inside of the shoes is very rough not finished properly..o should really return it but cannot be bothered . I bought the same style 1yr ago and wanted to replace it..but very disappointed..after takingvso long to arrive. Please pass on the message sole soft but the uppers very rough..might end up giving me blisters..will see. Very very disappointed 😞
"As others mentioned, these do stretch out.  When I first tried them on, I thought there was no way I could wear these.  Wore them around the house for a couple hours with thin socks on and they stretched out and are fine.  The inside has a scratchy thread that at first felt really uncomfortable.  As they stretched out, this wasn't noticeable."
Very comfortable shoe just slightly a little bit bigger than I expected probably cuz it doesn't have a lot of padding in it so I should have realize that but other than that they are really comfortable
"The are really nice shoes, I already had a pair tat was worn out, these are not the same size and fit small."
I already have a size 9 that fit so ordered again.  This 9 is too tight.
I wish they would have fit better. The 8.5 was more like a 7 for me.
Perfecto
These are super cute. Super comfy and work well withy my wider foot. I just love them!
"son super cómodos, quedan perfectos"
"These look and feel good. They fit long, so order half a size smaller that normal. They fit a narrow foot just fine. Was looking for a summer running shoe that didn't look like a running shoe. While these are a very comfortable shoe, they're not quite as comfortable as a running shoe for walking.So while they didn't work for me, they are still a great shoe, and I highly recommend them."
"Like: stylish yet comfy, my feet don’t hurt after an 8 hour shift.Dislike: they are breezey with the little holes so your feet may get cold."
Cute shoes. Ordered a size larger to fit my orthotics.  Shoes were too big. Returning.
"I rarely write reviews, but I felt like I had to for this shoe. This shoe is freaking comfy!!! That said, it runs a little large. I usually wear size 9m, I ordered a 9 and it's a bit too roomy, so I'll have  to order some toe box fillers to make it more snug. It looks great and is very breathable due to the perforation. You can dress it up or down. Overall, well worth the money, I just wish I got a half a size smaller."
"Glad I chose this shoe!  I too wear a wide and found these were the perfect fit with thin no show footies.  Really cute shoes, I've had several compliments on them.  And comfy - not too tight or too short, a good fit across the toes and the sole has good traction.  Well worth the money."
i am so glad that i made this purchase. they are a perfect fit true to size. i can wear these shoes for 9 hours a day at work with no foot pain
"I've been ""airing out"" these shoes for over a month and the chemical stink of them is still overwhelming. I discarded the box, so I assume I'm stuck with them. Otherwise they are cute and comfortable, but they weren't cheap enough to have to contend with this horrible manufacturing odor."
These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased. I have a wide foot and OMG! Had to order another pair now I have black and tan! I had bought and returned so many shoes because they were all narrow and hurt I take 7 71/2 but ordered size 7 wide. I stand and walk 8 hrs a day in them so happy with my purcase!
"These are great shoes!  Very comfy (padded in the sole) and fit perfectly.  They are also so light, you barely feel like you're wearing shoes."
Wearing these shoes is the equivalent of sending my tired feet on holiday! They are so comfortable for standing and walking-long days!
I mistakenly wrote that the pants did not come with the hoodie as the set I bought. I later found them rolled up in the hoodie....and this is a cute as they come for my 5 year old grandson.
Fits just right
"Really light and comfortable. Fresh foam makes every step enjoyable. This shoes is pretty wide, not for the narrow feet. Ordered two pairs already. One disappointment is that no different colors available."
J'adore la couleur et le confort
Excelente tenis
I love my shoes is very comfort and perfect for walking
I love the look and the feel of this shoe! I have had a lot of foot pain and they are super comfortable for all day wear and for walking. However there is something weird with the sole construction...I have 3 pair and it happens with all of them...they actually make you slip if say you run across water on the side walk. They even do this indoors on some occasions/surfaces =(Literally have almost ended up on the ground a dozen times. I do love the show otherwise so I still wear them I am now just aware and careful on water or super smooth surfaces. They need more grip. Time to hunt for a different model I think.
"I purchased these sneakers after much research.  New Balance sells them as a fantastic walking shoe.  The reviews rated this model with 4 to 5 stars and lots of positive feedback.  My intention was to get something comfortable to wear on a future trip to Germany where we expected  to do a lot of walking. I thought I had finally found what I was looking for......but unfortunately, they are not even close to comfortable.  At first I thought that I had to ""break them in"" so I was patient and kept wearing them for a 2 mile walk about 5 times since I purchased them.  Conclusion is that I cannot possibility consider wearing them.  After about 1 mile, the balls of my feet ache and I can't wait to take them off"
"I have tried every shoe possible for walking.  For the first time in years, after walking 5 miles on the treadmill, my calves did not hurt.  I have used them for about 3 days and am very impressed."
"I wear arch supports in my sneakers, and this shoe rubs the top of my right foot painfully when I walk.  The left shoe is a lot more comfortable.  I will have to put some type of additional padding on my right foot, if I continue wearing them.  This may be due to the arch support on that foot, but I need to wear them.  The shoe should be a little wider across the laces area, or have a better padded tongue."
Shoe fits correct but she has holes in both shoes in three months.  Have several other New Balance running shoes no problems years of use.  These three months of use and the holes in the fabric as if someone was using a drill to make them.  I wish I could get a line to NB and find out what went wrong with this style of shoe.
Love! Love! Love!  Theses shoes are so comfortable.  I feel like I am walking on clouds.  I bought these as workout shoes but wear them everywhere.  I feel like they kind of help me with my stride.  Almost propelling me to the next step and I love it.  When I workout in them I feel no pain in my feet or legs like I have felt in the past. Get these!  You won’t regret it.
"After using it for 2 weeks, very light and used it daily with or without socks to go places.  Comfortable and fitting a bit loose without socks. Will buy the black one for a second pair."
Très confortable - ressemble à une bonne qualité comme toujours de Teva
"The size 11 is adequately wide to fit my size 10 D/E wide foot, whereas size 10.5 was too narrow.  Lightweight, comfortable, breathable, and good stable gripping sole that appears durable.The laces do not hold a knot well.  TEVA should use better material for the laces.The tongue is attached on the sides to the upper, so it’s like a loafer with functional shoelaces."
"I’ve been waring Teva shoes for years, and I have only had problems with their sandals. They seem to run big.  So for that reason I no loner purchase them. (Sandals)"
"Bought these to ensure I had a pair of comfortable shoes for a trip to Spain. Wanted something that was as comfortable as a sneaker but with a dressier look. These fit the bill. Very lightweight and the sole seems durable. Not quite full running shoe comfortable, but close. A bit pricey IMO at $130, however."
These shoes are great and very comfortable.  I have had foot issues for years and these have been great. I am even a EEEE and they fit fine.
Good looking and comfy but too big.Biggest 11 size shoe I have ever encounter.  Returned.
I love these shoes. They have laces but they are stretchy slip ons. They are super comfy. I’d like to see a better looking version but other than that... nice!
Perfect fit! Very comfortable for everyday use in different ocassions.
Great lightweight all around walking and hiking shoe teva shoes are the best
Muy buen producto! Me ha gustado muchísimo! Lo volvería a comprar sin duda !!
Ma fille de 4 ans est ravie!
"Super cute shoes and for a great price. I took the advice of other reviewers and bought a size larger and I’m glad I did, they run small. I actually ordered these in the wide width to fit over my daughter’s orthotics. She doesn’t have them yet, but they look wide enough so I hope they’ll fit"
Extremely lightweight with zero support. They actually cause probation in the child's foot rather then ecoutage proper foot positioning. Orthotics will not fit and the soles are as tin as two pieces of paper glued together. Another wasted pair of kid sneakers.
Shoes are really cute. The tongue pull out far so they are easy to slip on. They are little smaller than other size 6 I have though. They are tight on my daughter's feet. Consider going up a size if you little one has thick feet.
"Compared to size 6.5W athletic shoe in another NB style that we already had, this shoe in size 7.0W was considerably SHORTER and NARROWER.  It shouldn't even be considered ""wide"". According to shoe label, size was correct. I have depended on New Balance for wide shoes. Disappointing."
I really like the look of these shoes but the velcro strap is a little difficult to reach the velcro where it attaches and does seem that secure.  Haven't come off yet though...
Love the look of these and my little guy seems to think they are comfortable. He does have a wide foot and I thought going up a size would give him time to grow into them however they fit him perfect now but don’t have much room for him to grow.
"These shoes are wonderful, so cute and easy for my 2 year old to put on by himself! We have gotten many compliments on them and new balance shoes always work well for my kids. Good shoe,  good price!"
"Love that these come in wide. I have three boys and they all have owned this style at some time. Durable shoe, easy to clean.  Holds up to a great deal of wear and tear."
"Excelentes están fenomenales, al venir de Amazon USA ya van 2 veces que no me llega con caja original , la cambian por maltrato de transporte en cuanto al tenis están de lujo"
Cómodas y bonitas
Der Schuh ist sehr bequem und leicht zu tragen. Alles so wie erwartet.
The sizing of these is way off. I listened to the reviews and ordered a whole size larger than normal (I wear a lot of NB shoes of this same style) and they were right I needed a whole size larger in length but they were very narrow. I returned them and ordered the same thing in a wide only to find that this shoe was not only wider but much longer also. so I guess you should order a half size larger and wide in order to get a proper fit? I give up.  I wouldn't recommend ordering these online unless you know for a fact what size is appropriate. Try these on first if at all possible.
"I purchased these shoes a little under 2 weeks ago and am not impressed with the durability of the stitching on them. I skate maybe an hour every other day but I do not do any crazy tricks, an Ollie and kickflip if I’m feeling it and this is just from a small time frame of wearing them. My previous vans half cabs lasted 9 months. I had heard good things about New Balance for skating but am not impressed with them at all. They are also not comfortable in the slightest, even after wearing them in a good bit. Maybe I got a bad batch but if not, do better New Balance."
"I ordered the 11.5 Wide, since New Balance has been exceptionally consistent in sizing for me. To my surprise, these did not fit when I tried them on. The reason is they're not the standard 4E wide for New Balance, but only 2E wide. I tried two of these before realizing the problem. They look great, but if you're buying it for the width, be sure to know they're not standard wides."
"I like these shoes.  They're comfortable, and look cool.  But like the other reviewers stated......order one to 1.5 sizes larger than you normally do."
I didn’t even know that New Balance made skate style shoes. These shoes look nice and feel great. The only thing I am not a fan of is the big “N” sticked on the side. Branding is branding... oh well. The shoes breathe and help keep the feet from getting a serious case of the stankfoot.
"I should have paid closer attention to the reviews!  I have purchased several New Balance shoes and these 9.5W are tighter than past pairs.  I have been thinking that the material will break in over time; however, the tightness is around the panels that secure the sides/laces.  That firm material doesn't seem to have much give and it immediately aches.  Other than, the shoe is well constructed.  I'm disappointed I will have to return the shoes for a 10W."
I bought my original fit that I buy for all shoes and these were nowhere near the size.  I couldn't even get the shoes on over my toes.  I got refund so no harm no foul.
Just the shoes I was looking for.
Fit properly and causal or dressy
The fit is fine. The shoe is way too squeaky. When you walk unless you are on carpet this is a really unpleasant shoe!!
"These sneakers are really cute looking, and pretty comfortable for someone on their feet for 9 hours a day. I am disappointed in the quality though, as the sole is peeling off the bottom already, with only 3 months of wear, wearing them 3 days a week."
A bit more “bubble gum” pink than I normally like
Love these shoes
Fits good and a little roomy but I needed room for orthopedics
"para ser de la marca arena, un desengaño porque ya están deformadas la suela y horma del pie."
"Schnelle Lieferung und genaue Passform. Farbe ist wie abgebildet. Gewünscht als praktischer Badeschlappen. Material trocknet schnell, da aus Kunststoff."
"Bel colore, spedizione Amazon velocissima. Unica cosa, sono precise, se si vuole essere comodi prendere una taglia in più."
Buenas chanclas para mujer
"Optimale Größe, gut verarbeitet."
Perfectas para la playa y piscina
Talla exacta
Tutto ok
Colore e come calzano ...Il piede è bellissimo
"Hochwertig, aber zu klein. Man sollte eine Nummer größer bestellen."
My son loves his crocs. He’s about to be a year and a half and he always puts these on himself. Whenever he wants to go outside and play he brings them to us it’s so cute. He loves them. The perfect let’s play in the garden shoe !
Fit perfectly on my wide footed child.
"Chi, come me, ha una mamma over 70 sa bene quanto i piedi a quella età diventino delicati. Ho provato con diversi modelli e marchi prima di trovare queste scarpe in offerta, ma erano troppo strette, pesanti, dure. Come immaginerete, non facevano affatto al caso suo. Quando ha provato queste scarpe, ha trovato davvero tutto quello che cercava. Sono davvero di ottima fattura, ottimi materiali, e anche gradevoli a differenza di molte scarpe per anziani. Le consiglio vivamente, in special modo alle donne con piedi delicati e doloranti."
"Ho regalato queste scarpe a mia moglie che è rimasta molto contenta.Sono davvero belle, leggere ma confortevoli nello stesso tempo.Ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo"
"Belle, ottima qualità e comodità."
"il prodotto corrisponde alla foto, mi sembrano scarpe di buona qualità, vedremo con l'utilizzo se saranno resistenti"
ottima scelta!
"Nicht gut, kann ich nicht tragen"
"Bright multi colors sneaker. Got a few compliments wearing them. True to size, but looks large due to the design similar to a triple s sneaker. Very comfortable. Will buy it again."
Feels great.  Love the color.
"Love puma, great seller."
Would have been awesome if it weren't for the pointy toes.
"Cumplido, recibi lo que pedi"
Súper bien excelente
Loved.
"gorgeous shoes! They fit my 10 year old daughter great and are actually wide enough to be comfortable!  finding shoes that fit her and are comfortable has been a challenge, but She loves these!"
Love them
Wide width size is not very roomy. Shoe is very snug. I do not recommend for kids with wide feet.
"These look great. But after two days of wear, look like this. I’m hoping they ledt through the spring."
Thanks to Amazon
This are really cute and have held up pretty nicely.
"I got these for my son, he is a chunky little guy and these are the only shoes that fit his feet. We tried about 10 different shoes from all the major companies like carters, adidas, nike, and convers. Even the ""wide"" shoes from other companies weren't wide enough. These are the only ones that fit him. The tongue opens up and has Velcro on both sides. These shoes really let you adjust to fit any size foot. When you open up the Velcro on both sides it makes sliding his foot into the shoe very easy. We were so impressed that I went ahead and got the next 2 sizes up just because I didn't want to have to go through all this again later when he got bigger."
As expected
"Absolutely love that I found this shoe. My 2 year old has wide feet, so regular slide on shoes don’t fit. I got a toddler 7 in wide and it fits amazing. Having the whole top bend so he can pretty much just put his foot right in is the best. He can take the shoes off by himself and we are working on him putting them on by himself. This is the second time I’ve bought the shoes (kids grow so fast) and I’ll probably buy a third pair. They may be more expensive than some shoes but I’d say well worth it. They seem to be comfortable as he doesn’t complain in any way while wearing them."
Good sneaker
Our kiddo loves running in these shoes. Easy to put on with Velcro but once they’re on the stay on. Easy to take off when you get home and have great supper for our daughter. We wanted to get the best as we believe in orthopedic comfort to the T
My Granddaughter loves them. Well made and stylish.
"My 3 year old was excited to see a picture of his shoes and said we should write a review...  He wears them every day and is able to put them on and take them on.  The only problem is that they often go on the wrong feet.  I suspect that the design of the shoe could be contributing since it is pretty symmetrical, but it's probably more because he is 3."
"Great shoe with nice support, stylish and sparkly"
Love this style. They are easy to adjust or tighten. Easy for a toddler to put on themselves. They fit as expected and don't cause any rubbing or discomfort.
The shoes are too hard to walk on.. they don't even bent so I don't understand how is comfortable to run on them. Not a good choice for a toddler.
Perfect for my son’s fat feet. I can get his foot in these shoes with ease. I’ve had a very hard time finding shoes to fit him. These are also a very cute style.
Perfect shoe for my student that uses afo’s. The tongue of the shoe with the Velcro on either side makes it so easy to put the shoe on over the afo.
Good quality Kidz Approved
These are great shoes that are easy to put over AFOs.
"Overall, great shoe! I can’t say now great they will be clipped in to my peloton (still waiting... delivery just got pushed back again) but I tried them on my cheaper bike that doesn’t use clip in pedals and they seem sturdy but breathable.I initially ordered a larger size since a lot of the other shoes I’ve tried tended to run narrow and small. These do not. I have wider feet and these are by far the most comfortable. They seem like they’re pretty sturdy and they’re easy to get on/off unlike other cycle shoes I have tried.Important to me is they fit my orthotics/inserts. I struggle with plantar fasciitis flare ups every now and then so I wear orthotics whenever I do any exercise, so if anyone was wondering, mine fit in this shoe just fine.No, they do not come with clips, so purchase those separately. Majority of cycle shoes don't come with clips btw.If anything happens with them, I’ll update but from my use so far, they fit my wide-ish feet, are comfortable, easy on/off, and I actually think the print is fun!"
"I really wanted to like these shoes, but in the end I don't feel like they are safe. I made the screws as tight as possible but there was still a good bit of slide or wiggle from left to right on the petal making it feel unsafe. I also found the tongue to be too long and the sharp edge of the material pressed into the top of my ankle. Lastly the screws it comes with are a joke...they have no grip...but that may not be a problem if your  clips come with their own screws."
"I absolutely love these! I've had 2 pair in the past. A pair of Shimano's and a sandal-type, which both felt like hard boards on my feet. These are amazing! Cleats were simple to measure and put on and the cycling experience on my spin bike was awesome. I felt my foot connecting with the pedal like never before. It's almost as if they give! VERY comfortable, cool colors and IMHO a good cycling shoe for the money. Highly recommend these!"
So these shoes fit absolutely perfect! Exactly as shown in the pictures! I love the colors for sure. I used to teach spin before the covid pandemic and these will keep me in the saddle till it’s over so I can resume teaching classes! I would recommend this purchase.
"Compré estos zapatos para andar en bicicleta de ruta, pero con respecto a la talla son muy grandes. Compré otros para mountain bike de otra marca y la misma talla y me quedaron bien. Pero estos parecen una talla mas grande"
"The shoes fit very tight. They are not best suited for wider feet even with adjusting the tightness of the laces. Overall, not the best quality."
"These are perfect, added the attachment for my peloton to the shoe and they are perfect."
Best bang for your buck. Use these with my Peloton. No regrets!
comfortable so far -have only done 4 rides but no issues yet.  Cute and comfy.
Very comfortable and true to size
"La zapatilla en si muy bien. Bonita, tal cual se aprecia en las imágenes, y parece bien contruida con una suela confortable. El problema, que parece que es extensible a todas las New Balance, es el tallaje.En serio, pedimos una 39 y bien podía haber sido una 37. Así que asegurarse antes de hacer algún pedido de esta marca.La devolución de 10 por parte de Amazon. Una pena que no hayamos podido pedir dos tallas más, puesto que la oferta terminó."
"Son estrechas en la punta, lo que provoca daño en las uñas. Por lo demás, son unas zapatillas muy cómodas, ideales para el running. una vez que las ha dado de si, son perfectas."
"Schuhe müssen 1,5 Nummern größr bestellt werdaen als mormal!Sehen sehr gut aus!"
"Très déçue par la marque.Décrites comme des baskets de running alors qu'elles ont déjà la gomme de la semelle arrière (extérieure) ""mangée"" par le bitume, en seulement 2 footings de 15 km.Le prix (hors les 20%) est pourtant assez élevé !Première et dernière expérience pour cette marque, prochain achat, je retourne chez acics."
Muy bonitas
Perfecta
Comfortable shoe with a great sole for grip.
great shoes!!! I have been wearing Merrell's for almost a decade now and keep coming back to them.
"Started out very supportive but still comfortable. Only stayed waterproof for about two weeks. Then they started tearing on the sides of both shoes in the same spot after 2 months. I think it's just a poor design. For $130 definitely spend your money elsewhere. I love and swear by my other merrel's but these are a total miss. Soles still look great and love the color and styling, just wish they would last longer."
"UPDATE: April 2019 (original review below):  By November 2018, I stopped wearing these shoes regularly because they were just too hot to wear comfortably for long periods.  I cannot recommend these shoes because they just become too hot.  The heat results in excessive sweating and the shoes smell bad as a result.  Find another pair.  Reducing review to two stars.-----------Original review:I ordered these Merrell Men's Moab fST Waterproof Hiking Shoes to replace a set of Keen hiking shoes that I had worn out.  The Keens are excellent shoes and very comfortable, but they tend to get extensive wear on the soles (particularly for me, the heels wear out within 9 mos).  This review is my initial impression and I will update if anything changes.FIT:  The shoes fit as expected.  They seem a bit tighter than the Keen equivalent but are as expected for the size.COMFORT: These waterproof shoes get hot and are hotter than the Keen equivalent waterproof shoe.  The foot bed is definitely not as good as the Keen, probably the most notable difference.WATERPROOF: So far, so good.  I had to wade into shallow water and my feet were dry until the water got deep enough to overtop the shoe.OVERALL QUALITY: I have high hopes that the heel on this shoe will not wear as quickly.  Quality of the shoes seems very high.I rate these shoes as 4 stars out of 5, with the subtraction coming for the less comfortable foot bed than the competition and the lessened breathability resulting in more heat in the foot.  I can't help but feel that if the shoe had a breathable but waterproof fabric, the shoes would feel cooler and more comfortable for extended wear."
"I've been a Merrell wearer for around 10 years, now and have wanted to try their more casual line.  I typically buy Moabs or Chameleon Stretch Gore-Tex and expected these to feel a lot more flimsy.  While they are a little lighter, they still feel durable and look to be well made.  The laces are heavy-duty and a good length.  The Vibram soles feel a little softer than what the Moabs use, but I haven't noticed quick wear on them.  I haven't tested them for water resistance, at this point, but will update if I do.Pros:Lighter than the outdoor hiking shoes.Look sharp and athletic.Good gripping soles.Fits as expected.Comfortable for hiking and light running.Cons:The fit is a little less secure than the outdoor shoes, do to the lack of the ""heel lock"" lace hole.  I wish it was there, but since I wanted these for a casual shoe, it's not a deal-breaker.Arch is a little higher than I expected.  It could break in to where it needs to be after a while.Update:These just aren't breaking in to be comfortable and the loose fit around the ankle is becoming a problem.  I wear low / no-show socks and it rubs badly on the heel area."
"I've had these for about a year and only wear them when I go hiking or when it's raining. Up until the other day I wasn't even going to write a review because I wasn't especially impressed or dissatisfied. However, I just returned from a backpacking trip here in Florida and these shoes performed as well as I could ever have expected. Specifically, while walking through a muddy, flooded trail (that was the result of a wrong turn, oops), I was able to keep me feet completely dry and had no loss of traction over difficult conditions. I was amazed. Highly recommended!!"
"I purchased these 6 months ago and was very excited to see a pair of vegan waterproof pair of Merrels. However, was very disappointed that theses didn't seem to be waterproof, more water resistant. Also, the the back started to get worn out very quickly. I'm an avid hiker and don't really take it easy on my hiking shoes tbh. So I reccomend another pair of you are looking for a sturdy waterproof pair of hiking shoes."
"The shoes are very comfortable and maintain traction on dry and wet surfaces. BUT I definitely would not call these waterproof. The first time I was walking through the rain and wet grass water my socks and feet got very wet, and two days later the shoes still have not completely dried. For that reason I'm giving this shoe 2 stars."
"I wore these intermittently for a year and a half.  After about a year of mild use, the stitching started to come apart on each shoe near the toe (same problem observed by others).  This lets in the water and soaks my feet. For the little these were used, I expected more durability.  The Vibram sole is great and shows almost no wear while the rest of the shoe is failing."
"I love these shoes.  They are very light-weight.  I am on my feet in a factory setting 8-12 hours per day.  Vibram soles are awesome and rarely wear out before the uppers.  That said, I have never had a pair of Merrell hiking shoes wear out within a 12 month period.  Like I said, I work in a large factory setting on concrete, up and down ladders, on my knees, and walking on abrasive surfaces.  They are awesome."
"I returned the boots because the quality was not as depicted. The materials and the finishes were of lower quality than expected and a huge disappointment to me when I receive them. Additionally, the boots were very uncomfortable when I tried them on. Seller doesn’t want to refund me."
"Full disclosure... I am returning these boots. The boots are good for the price, seem decently well made, the leather sole is nice; only wore them around the house for a few minutes but the boots seem comfortable. But... they run BIG. I consistently wear a 10.5 in most brands of cowboy boots/11.5 running shoes. The Soto boots were too wide and too long for me with too much heel slip and loose around the vamp. Boot fit is a very individual thing, unfortunately these boots aren't a match for me for wise."
Definitely made for a wide foot and fit me well but it looked funny to me with the wide toe and the sole too far past the edge of the shoe.
"Was excited to get these boots as a gift for my boyfriend. As soon as they where delivered I opened the box to look at them and noticed they are damaged. I’m not satisfied; as they are a gift I am supposed to be giving him tomorrow. For the cost I expect better quality, not to mention now I’m giftless :( Will return."
"Bought this pair after buying the first pair. They look great, are very comfortable and affordable. New Soto fans here!!!"
"Happy with the boots, they are just as advertised. Not the same as my Ariat boots but also not the price of them either. Would buy again for sure."
This is not at all as described . It’s not textured it’s smooth and the designs do not show very much either. Terrible quality for the price.
Love the product.  Price is fabulous as is quality
Love them
A little big but I love them
En 15 días ha perdido bastante su color original. Dudo que sean originales.
muy buena calidad
Compré para regalar
"I had these for walking, its seems NB make sneakers better for people that do a lot of walking. I came across them when i was just browsing thru sneakers and came to these with a low  price, i bought them and stored them as replacement. I prefer the camou version of these shoes but these white color ones will do. Bought them for $27.37, while these can go for as high as $50 plus, so money save."
"Got the greenish grey ones on sale for $25.  For that price, I'm very happy.  They have that spandex inner lining kinda like a sock between the sole and tongue of the shoe but I don't mind it."
"Design, and style on a buget, nice to slip on and off with out socks, great for the beach, and a shoe you can just slip on and off, and still look DaD cool in the process, ,LoL"
Comfortable shoes but they run small. I don’t normally wear a size 12 shoe but it seems like NB shoes run small. Originally had an 11 but that was very snug. Walked all day at an amusement park and my feet felt fine afterwards.
My son loves these New Balance skate shoes!It did take a week or so to break the shoes in because my son has a very high instep and these shoes don't allow alot of instep room
Great skate shoes . My son loves them and the green looks really good in person.
"I like everything about this shoes; however, the only complaint that I have is that the color is starting to fade after 4 months of normal use. Besides that, it is a pretty comfty and good looking product."
"Veramente delle scarpe bellissime, soltanto consiglio di prendere un numero in meno rispetto al vostro abituale! Ottima qualità e fattura! 👍"
beau modèle mais renvoyé car taille très très serrée (je n'ai pas les pieds large). déçu par ce modèle.
"La linguetta sopra i lacci è Cucita rendendo impossibile calzare la scarpa. Avevo preso un 44,5 ma appena arrivata mi sono reso conto della assurdità difronte alla quale mi trovavo.Come può un piede entrare nella scarpa che ha l’apertura così piccola!!!!!SUBITO FATTO IL RESO"
"Chaussures de qualité, parfaites pour s'accorder avec toutes les tenues. le tout à un prix correct, je suis ravie et le principal intéressé aussi."
chaussures qui semblent solides ( voir à l'usage )  mon fils 12 ans les trouve très sympaelles chaussent grand
"Le model chausse petit je m'en sors grâce au fait que j'ai un autre enfant qui a pu les mettre, sinon rien à dire sur le reste c'est une chaussure de bonne qualité."
My son is loving these! They hold up pretty well compared to nylon shoes. He did just show me a spot where the front is coming away from the sole but with an 11 yr old boy that may just be normal wear and tear! He could be a shoe tester or I need to become a cobbler!
Last minute purchase because I needed to find all black sneakers that are part of a school uniform.  None of the stores had any.  I don't like getting shoes online because of potential fit problems.  But these were accurate to size and allow the kid to run around and still look presentable.
Our family loves DC's but these fell apart super quick. My son pulled on a loose string and the whole sole on one shoe unraveled and came apart. Bummer.
"This was a great purchase, it was delivered in great time. The only downside was the size of the box, which caused additional charges to eat into the savings i had made on this discounted item. However, that was unavoidable on the sellers part, so no marks lost there."
Finally found a shoe that lasts more than a few months on my active 10 year old boy. Will purchase again.
My son loves them.  They fit and look as described.  Weren't too small or too big or too narrow.  They fit just perfect.
"We knew that this brand runs large, so we ordered a half size smaller.  That adjustment gave a good fit that allowed for some growth.  My grandson loves these shoes.  The quality and styling are great."
This does not appear to be genuine adidas. There's so many loose threads. The nubuck trim is kinda cheap feeling. The inside is very hard. The outside feels like umbrella material.The sides don't have any padding of any kind. They look nice from afar but up close it's obvious they are fake.
"These sneakers are super comfy & fit true to size. Love that they’re nice & light but still give plenty of all round support to the foot. I’m a Peraonal trainer & wear sneakers daily, I would absolutely recommend these!"
"Fits as expected, stylish and at a great price. Many of my coworkers and friends have ordered them or bought them from other places. Love these shoes!!"
So the shoes look nice and all but I’m 99.9% positive they are made out of plastic to the point where I have marks around my ankles from the shoes cutting into them. They did not come with adidas tags or an adidas box it just looks like illegal knockoffs. Had to purchase separate insoles for them I need them for work but I doubt they will last longer than a month or two. So unfortunate
"I love the shoes; color and fit. Except the tongue is a bit too long and my skin gets a little irritated, but I can live with it."
They are thick and hot!Runs true to size.
"I love it all, I had order half size smaller because I’m usually 6 but they were a littler small for me. I changed them for 6 1/2 and yay!!! Beautiful!"
"Se los regalé a mi novia y le gustaron mucho. Cumplió gran parte de mis expectativas. La talla de los tenis se ajustaron perfectamente.Lo malo fue que uno de los tenis tenía un poco deteriorado (algo mínimo) la zona de gamuza, pero por el costo esperaba que llegue más intacto."
"Like many other reviews, I find these to be pretty narrow. The length is great but they fit tight around the front, wide part of my foot (where the balls of your feet are). Even with the laces loose, they are quite tight. I also have fairly small feet (5 women’s)."
Cute. Order a 1/2 size down.
These are great spikes that dig well into the track and feel comfortable on the feet. I like wearing pumas a lot and these spikes are very underrated.
"It's a nice shoe, yes singular shoe. I only received one."
Después de haber entrenado CrossFit unos meses con tenis para entrenamiento “normal” y haber probado estos no quiero volver a quitármelos. Se nota la diferencia inmediatamente.
"Son excelentes para CrossFit, este es mi tercer par, no dejan de ser cómodos y prácticos al hacer wod's, me gusta mucho el color, están nuevas, aunque en aduanas los abren para checarlos y estaban como sucias de las puntas, aún así son excelentes, llegaron antes de lo esperado, tenían como tierra de las puntas, la verdad o es porque no les gusta vender al extranjero o algo raro pasó, no se notan usados pero tal vez fue la devolución, el caso es que si están muy muy nuevas, me encantan son el tercer par que tengo de Nano 9"
"Sin muy cómodos para CrossFit , con la punta amplia para que el pie se apoye con todo. Los volvería a comprar soy mujer con talla 7 mexicano pedí número 9 de hombre americano , quedó como lo esperaba"
"Son muy cómodos para entrenar y cumplen al 100 con el objetivo, no se derrapan y el refuerzo en el talón ayuda para afianzar cuando cargas pesos altos."
"Hola,Quisiera saber si me pueden generar una orden de devolución gratis ya que el costo de devolución es el 80% del costo de producto. Me quedaron muy chicos y no viene especificado que deben de pedirse por lo menos medio número más grandes ya que este tipo de calzado viene reducido.Gracias"
"Son de hombre pero los compré para mi del 6.5. Yo calzo del 6 y aunque si me quedaron ese medio número grandecitos, me encantaron y son extremadamente cómodos para hacer Crossfit, no se resbalan y tienen un gran soporte en los tobillos. Sin duda los volvería a comprar."
"Excelente par para crossfit, cómodo y fiel a la talla... A muy buen precio, hay comentarios que mencionan qué vienen mal pegados, yo tuve la suerte de que viniera impecable y a un muy buen precio"
fits well. perfect for daily jogging or some indoors activities
So hard to find this product .. but Amazon had it !
"Tenis super chingones para hacer crossfit ya que te dan la estabilidad que necesitas, son muy cómodos, los materiales se ven resistentes y el diseño esta muy chingon"
Mi chiedo come mai il venditore è poco attento nel verificare l'integrità del prodotto. Se si acquista un prodotto si deve dare anche la sicurezza all''acquirente!!! A nessuno farebbe piacere ricevere una scarpa già screpolata in punta . Pessimo!!! (E spero che il rimborso sia super veloce)
"Lange nach einem braunen Turnschuh gesucht,der ist einfach perfekt. Sieht schick aus und ist sehr bequem"
Sempre il top in tutto!!!!la scarpa è come riprodotta in foto...amazon una garanzia!!!!
Ottimo
"Schnell geliefert, passt, topp!"
Deportivo muy cómodo y precioso.
piaciuto tutto
Me encantan !!
ayant déjà ces baskets et très contente de leur durée et de leur confort
très belles baskets
"comodidad, no pesan nada, contenta"
"Mi hija está encantada con sus zapatillas de deporte. Son ligeras, cómodas, fáciles de poner (importante en una niña de 10 años) para no tener cordones y muy divertidas por su colorido"
"diferentes, cada una de un color.Muy cómodas"
"Für die anstehende kalte Jahreszeit braucht unser Sohn (3,5 Jahre) wieder neue Schuhe. Da wir im letzten Winter sehr gute Erfahrungen mit Stiefeln von Jack Wolfskin gemacht haben, sind wir dabei geblieben und haben erneut bestellt.Die Schuhe wurden zügig im üblichen Schuhkarton, und in Folie verpackt, geliefert. Die Schuhe in einem dunklen Blau und mit heller Sohle inklusive weißem Streifen gefallen uns und unserem Sohn sehr gut. Gerade den Pfotenabdruck bringt er schnell in Verbindung mit einer seiner Lieblingssendungen („Paw Patrol“).Die Schuhe sind tadellos verarbeitet, alle Nähte und Klebestellen sind akkurat ausgeführt. Die Sohle ist schon dick und mit grober Struktur. Das sorgt für eine gute Isolierung und besten Grip. Der Klettverschluss erlaubt es unserem Sohn die Schuhe allein an- und auszuziehen. Die Schuhe sind schön dick gefüttert, ganz oben zudem mit Kunstfell verziert.Wir sind uns sicher, dass auch dieses Paar schön warm und wasserdicht ist – ohne die Füße zu sehr ins Schwitzen zu bringen. Der Hersteller wirbt nicht umsonst mit 100% Wetterschutz dank Texapore (wasserdicht bis 10.000mm Wassersäule und atmungsaktiv > 3.400g/m²/24h). Unser Sohn hat Schuhgröße 27, hier haben wir eine 28 bestellt (bedingt durch die dicken Wintersocken) und die Schuhe haben sehr gut gepasst. Die Schuhe wurden in Kambodscha hergestellt.Wir sind mit den Schuhen sehr zufrieden und sehen den kalten Tagen gelassen entgegen."

"Ein toller Schuh für den Winter.Mein Sohn (3) kann sie prima alleine anziehen, lediglich das festziehen geht mit einer Hand eher nicht so gut.Sie sind mindestens Wasserabweisend. Allerdings ist er damit auch schon durch tiefe Pfützen gestampft, wo ich definitiv mit nassen Füßen gerechnet hatte-dem war aber nicht so. Sind sie längere Zeit Nässe ausgesetzt, kommt es langsam durch, ist eben kein Gummistiefel :-)"
"Diese Schuhe passten unserem Sohnemann  sofort und nichts drückte. Wir hatten die Schuhe eine Woche in gebrauch und haben sie dann zurück geschickt da er jeden Tag feuchte oder nasse Füße hatte. An 2 Tagen dieser Woche hatte er nasse Füße von nur durch nasse Wiese oder über nasse Wege laufen. Und dass trotz der, vor Benutzung, empfohlenen Imprägnieren.Einzige plus ist dass die Schuhe warm gehalten haben und wirklich flexibel sind.Wir haben aber dann Schuhe einer anderen Marke bestellt, die zusätzlich auch wasserdicht sind :)"
"Well we liked those shoes until my daughter went out to the snow yesterday. Unfortunately her feet got soaked and the shoes aren’t dried out a day later. So pretty disappointed since I have bought them for those reasons, to be waterproof and snow proof:("
Super angenehm...wirklich warme Füße! Sehen sehr schick aus und  wie Turnschuhe leicht und super angenehm zum tragen. Einfach zum öffnen und schliessen dank Klettverschluss! Würde ich nächstes Jahr wieder bestellen!!
"The shoes are great, very soft and comfortable inside. Its waterproof still have to be tested on the snow but for walking they feel great. My son loves them (we have the same size so I was able to test them as well)."
die schuhe halten super warm sind echt klasse mein sohn zieht sie echt gerne an nur die fallen echt klein aus und sind definitiv nichts für dicke füsseobwohl er gerade mal 26 anzieht passt ihm 27 so als wäre es die grösse 26anstonsten echt super stabile schuhekann ich nur weiter empfehlen!
Die Schuhe sind sehr gut verarbeitet und wärmen gut. Sehr zu empfehlen
"Ich bin sehr positiv überrascht wie toll die Schuhen sind. Sind kuschelig und halten warm..., wasserfest sind es auch . Mein Sohn liebt es und schwärmt von denen.Habe 31 bestellt obwohl er 30 Größe, hat. Passt wie angegossen.Die sind perfekt und würde es 100% weiter empfehlen  ."
La talla exacta yo lo compre en 730 pesos para ese precio una ganga. Spikes muy bonitos y se ven resistentes
Producto de gran calidad y la entrega en el tiempo señalado.
Purchased for my son. Plays in a compatible men’s baseball team. He loves them! He says they are True to size and color. Very comfortable to wear through double headers.
"Lo compré a muy buen precio y quedamos muy satisfechos. Me gusta esta marca porque por dentro es un zapato de piel, aunque por fuera sea una zapatilla.Lo recomiendo."
Run smaller than other shoes the same size.  I would recommend ordering at least one half size larger or maybe even on full size larger.
"Nos encantan. Comodidad, sobre todo porque el peque tiene el empeine alto y no es fácil encontrar calzado que no le deje marca."
Very comfortable. Wide width isn’t overly wide. Color in picture accurate. Cleat on the foreheel helps the grip.
"El exterior del zapato ya me hacía presagiar que había sido usado, pero la plantilla interior me lo confirmó… Realmente decepcionante que te vendan un producto usado. Lógicamente lo he devuelto."
"Great price, fast shipping.My kid loves the Pedroia spikes."
"Cómodos, bonitos y de calidad. Mi bebé no se los intenta quitar como otros y el sistema de velcro les da un plus en comodidad y autonomía."
Wish I could still return.  Missed the window.  Way too small for the size.
Very difficult to find cleats for a 10 year old with man sized feet.  Amazing  and happily surprised.  Had to search for cleats that did not have metal spikes for youngsters playing baseball.  Well done and thank you
Fits as expected and really clean up good.  Daughter plays on brick dust field and shoes clean up good👍🏻
"We ordered these cleats for our girls 12-year-old son. It is his first time moving up to metal and they are GREAT! They are super lightweight and fit perfectly! They run true to size so no need to size up or down. They look sleek and are, as he says, “fire’!"
"Super Schuh,der zu allem passt"
質感も色も想像してた通りでメッチャお気に入りになりました。
If you are looking for a high quality sneakers thats the one for you!!!
Great looking and very comfortable.
"Beautifully made, wonderful feeling first day, no break in needed at all, a bit narrow thou. Never disappointed at Ecco ever! LOVED IT"
"I often order by amazon shoes 6,5 which is 39-39,5 like EU sizes.But now ,you send me a shoes which is 37 and of course it is too small for me. Does not fit to me."
Four months regular walking use and there is already a hole on the top part of the shoe. The piece delivered could have been factory reject sold by the seller.
Die Lieferung kam schneller als im Vorfeld angegeben. Die Ware war gut verpackt und hatte die gewünschte Qualität.Gut für etwas breitere Füße und einen höheren Spann geeignet.
"Es wird mit dem GTX Modell geworben, es kommt allerdings das ganz normale Modell an.. ging darum sofort zurück."
Wie gewohnt tolle Qualität würde immer wieder Schuhe von Giesswein kaufen
Alles ok
Es calentita y elegante mi hija esta encantada. 😊
No tiene nada que ver en comodidad y confort con las crocs originales
esta genial
The material quality of upper side looks a bit cheap despite being very light weight...And BOOOMMM!! RETURNED IT...
They fit perfectly but felt cheap and sounded like a crunching plastic bag. For that amount of money you could at least await some decent quality and not the cheap crap that feels like counterfeit products.
I work in film so I spend very long work days mostly on my feet. These fit great (other NB makes have been a bit small) and stay comfortable for the whole day.
Product ok .... But new balance box is missing .... Where is my box!?????
Très confortable!
Very comfy shoes that look stylish. This brand is a bit more expensive than adidas and Nike but they make shoes that have a better fit in my experience. I recommend these shoes.
"Entrega antes de lo previsto, lo que pagué es lo que esperé el color, el diseño, además están super cómodos."
"I liked the fit, the looks and everything else. Very happy with the purchase. I ordered a second pair. Thank you...!!"
Great fit and soOoo comfortable 👍
“Brand new” looks like someone tried them on and spilled their coffee on the left sneaker then returned them where at the customer service center they were lackadaisically inspected before being reclaimed as New and entered back into the stock for a lucky customer like myself to reap all the benefits of their insouciance.
"Die Sohle der Schuhe ist viel zu hart, ich weiß nicht wer solche Kinderschuhe herstellt. Ich habe sie kein bisschen gebogen bekommen. Das Design an sich ist schön."
"Gewohnt Hohe Richter Qualität. Perfekt für den etwas schmaleren Fuß, fällt meines Erachtens eine halbes Nummer kleiner aus.Unaufgeregtes dezentes Design."
"Wie erwartet, Richter schuhe mit einer sohle die rausgenommen werden kann und dann passt es auch für kleine mittel-breite Füße! Mussen imprägniert werden und dann sind die für Herbst bis Winter geeignet! Ich werde die wieder kaufen nächstes Jahr! Im Angebot für 25 Euro gekauft, bin sehr zufrieden"
Die schuhe sind eher für schmale Füße gedacht
"Super Schuhe! Halten schön warm und sind perfekt für Herbst, Winter und Frühling 😊"
Extremely comfortable. I have chronic plantar fasciitis in both feet and find these help a lot.
"I purchased for walking.  I read reviews and most said these ran big.  I kept to my normal size, but normally I would have went up one size due to the fact these were not listed as wide.  They fit perfectly, the width is just right and they do not slip on my heel.  I would recommend these for walking.  They are not the prettiest shoes and don't look good with shorts to go out.  They probably would be fine with a pair of long pants.For my purpose to have comfortable walking shoes they are perfect."
Always love Sketchers--always get the Sketcher Go Walk--I am dissapointed in this pair--they are my usual size and they seem not to have the fit all my others have ever had--will try another pair because that is all I wear
"Very comfortable, I had to get 1/2 size smaller. I sent the original size back 7 1/2 to order a 7. They are perfect."
These shoes were really large.  I’ve worn Sketchers for years but the box stated stretchy fit and was not consistent with my other Sketchers which were basically the same style.  Stretch fit needs to be included in the description so that I can avoid them in the future.
Shoes comfortable on foot but too large in heel area. A shorter size would not fix issue.
"I love Skechers! So very comfortable! I love that they have extended sizes in women’s. You can wash these shoes, as with all of the shoes like this over and over."
"Love these shoes. They’re about a half size too large, but with thicker socks will be just fine."
Not quite the comfortable dog walking shoes of my dreams.  A little snug for my size 11 tootsies.  Returned for full refund.
The shoe was a perfect fit very comfortable and a light shoe cant tell I have them on. Going to buy another pair in different color.Great buy. Rate of 5 stars
"Would prefer it slipped on easier but good considering price.  Quite happy to find a shoe that was actually 6E, a true extra wide.  Can hold an insert."
Nice shoes
They sewed the damn shoe laces into the back of the shoe. Now in order to switch to the type of laces I prefer I have to cut the original laces so that I can put the ones I like in. I'll wait for a bit before I do that but this is not starting off well.What even worse is they didn't even make the laces even before sewing the lace into the back end of the shoe so on one foot the lace is a solid 6 inch longer on one side. I can get past this for a comfortable shoe but it's a severe annoyance that when I do replace the laces that I cannot run them the way they were intended to go...Stupid move on the manufacturers part. They got 2 stars so far because they fit like they are supposed to but still really annoyed about the laces being sown in....
"I've had these shoes before and I loved the comfort and fit, but this model has some serious problems.  Firstly, the shoe has a serious design flaw.  The laces are sewn in place and not replaceable!  The laces wrap all the way around the heel, as a real moccasin would, but they are sewn in at the heel.  If your lace wears out, as mine did, the shoe is worthless.  The first time this happened, New Balance was kind enough to replace the shoe.  The second time, the shoe was  pretty well worn out, so I just bought a new pair.  That's when I discovered the second problem.  After only wearing the shoe a week (a week!) the leather ripped out along the stitching near the base of the tongue on the left shoe.  OK, no problem, I returned the shoe to Amazon and got another pair.  The 2nd pair popped a stitch at the same place on the right shoe BEFORE I GOT THE SHOE ON MY FOOT!!  Just opening up the shoe caused a tear.  Now I have to return the second pair too, this time for a refund.It looks like NB is having some manufacturing problems, (you can see how some stitching is off a tiny fraction, actually weakening the leather by crossing the pre-punched holes where pieces are stitched together) so as much as I liked this shoe when I first bought it several years ago, I won't be buying it again anytime shoe."
"These Dunham Captain boat shoes retail for $120 and I paid less than $40 here on Amazon.  So, that's good.  The shoes are actually very good quality with excellent functionality.  The fit is as expected and it wears like a comfortable tennis shoe.  The sole is non-slip rubber and it grips great.  I spent 7 days on my boat in wet conditions right after buying these shoes and they preformed like a champ.  The leather is water-proof.  The shoe will not get water-logged.  The nylon vents (light brown areas) allowed for water drainage (I did walk in the water a few times just to see how they functioned).  There's also what New Balance calls a ""rollbar"" in the heal.  Basically, it provides stability to prevent your ankle from rolling right or left.. oddly, I found this feature very beneficial.  When you're walking on a slipper surface, your ankles can do funny thing.  This rollbar functions from below your heel... it's not like an ankle brace, but it works great.  So the design and functionality is excellent.  I'm not sure about the quality since I've only owned them for about a month. They're made in China.  If New Balance made them in the USA (like the 990s), I would've given these shoes 5 stars."
"What an awesome, high-quality, comfortable shoe. I can't say I've been able to say that for the past decade or so -- it seems most shoes are only built to last about three months before they fall apart.I have enormous feet and - as I'm sure anyone reading this for that very reason understands - it is difficult to find stylish, comfortable shoes for everyday wear.If you have a large, wide food -- look no further. This shoe not only fit me perfectly out of the box, it was nearly 100% perfectly comfortable with minimal break-in (just under a week with minimal wear), and looks great to boot. The soles are thick enough to offer great support, but not thick and awkward enough that they look like clunky orthopedic clown shoes.This shoe looks great with slacks and would fit in a dressy or casual environment. I'll be picking up a spare set out of fear that they stop making them.PROS:•Great Fit for Wide Feet (4E)•Quality Construction•Comfortable for All-Day Wear / Walking•Doesn't Look Like a Boat on Your Foot (round-toe shoes in large sizes tend to look comical)CONS:•Stiff Heel for the First Week (I taped my heels under my socks to minimize blisters; heel seems to have broken in within 4 days)•Toe is Rounded (I prefer squared toes for style reasons, but this still looks nice)"
"Stylish, super comfortable and surprisingly rugged, I wore these on a seven day whitewater rafting trip through the Grand Canyon (280 miles, 180 rapids, including the dreaded 'Lava Falls"" rapids) - then wore them 'most everywhere in North-central Arizona.Was surprised at how well they drained and dried - and remained pliable.They 'spiffed up' right back to nearly new with just a little cleaning and a couple of coats of polish.I'm a triple-E or even quad-E width. These fit perfectly, so for those with w i d e  feet, these are a real find.  Still very comfortable.  Often wear them with no socks, so I use a foot spray to eliminate foot odors (and that strategy works fine).  Highly recommend."
"I have issues with my big feet, so I took a chance with these. Happy I did, big enough for my sasquatch feet, and wide enough as well. Comfy too. Not a lot of arch support, but I have worn worse. One down side was trying to replace the laces with elastic ones. The lace runs around the side and back of the shoe, trying to pull them out did not work well. Tying laces is an issue for me, but that is an issue for me, even so, I did knock off a star. Be aware, and hope the laces last as long as the shoes. Or you may have to get creative to replace a broken lace."
"Have ordered and am now waiting on my 3rd pair of Dunhams. Luv'em. I can lace them tight and wear as regular lace-ups, or loosen laces and wear as loafers. They are comfortable either way. I nearly wore out the tops of my 1st pair, (don't think it is possible to wear out the soles) but before discarding them, I tried applying some shoe polish to the leather top part, and presto, nearly new shoes. Still wearing them as backups. I can wear them with or without socks; they are great either way."
"I got the 14 XW tan boat shoe. Tan hides dirt and dust better than the blue boat shoes I ordered the last time. They were 14 Wide which shows 14EEEE on the shoe tongue. The new tan 14XW shows 14 6E on the inside of the shoe tongue. Both pairs fit my duck feet comfortably right out of the box. No break in time required. The mesh on these shoes help my feet to breathe, and be cooler in the hot months. The old blue pair lasted 3 years as nearly the only shoes I wore."
"It's a weightlifting shoe. I Originally bought the adistar 2008s over 10 years ago and I'm trying to use different shoes when I'm not aggressively lifting since they are triple or more the price from when I got them and I want them to last. The Adipower is ok by comparison. The toe bot accommodates my wide feet and I'm able to reasonably tighten them so my foot feels secure. I trust them more than the shoes with the weird tightening mechanism. You may not fall in love with them, but they aren't that expensive and have a non compressible heel. I think some other people talked about doing things other than lifting. They have little in the way of padding, which is good. I wouldnt suggest doing cardio or walking in them (I get sore from the foot up if i walk too long in lifting shoes). You can bend your foot enough for the split jerk if you Olympic Lift. It does well for squats and is good for push press, wall balls, etc"
"I bought these and the Legacy lifter, Ended up returning the legacy lifter and bought an extra pair of these. They give you all the support but are not extremely rigid and heavy like the legacy lifter. I really enjoy using these shoes!"
Love them! Been wanting a bright color for weightlifting.  Very unique color! Does the job for lifting. I am 6 1/2 in women's  and got 4.5 they fit great!
Amazing!
They are comfortable so I can wear them all day long.
I was pleased to find a nice slip-on shoe in a narrow size.  I find it to be comfortable and stylish.
My son loves these shoes. Style and comfort!
My shoes came in with stains on them and scratches along the bottom of the shoe
it’s perfectand I love Amazon
It was dirty and a different color. I return it
Ottimo servizio e ottimo il prodotto!
Comunicación muy rápida con el vendedor. Producto de muy buena calidad.
Para trabajar
questi stivali sono davvero di qualità ottima d'altronde le linee tedesche raramente peccano in qualcosa. ho dovuto rendermi solo perché indosso a mio figlio di un anno e mezzo sono troppo alti per l'asilo nido in più essendo di ottima qualità non sono di plasticotto ma sono davvero di gomma è molto imbottiti all'interno e quindi un po' più pesantini per uno che cammina da appena sei mesi.. diciamo che per un bambino dai 3 anni in su sono perfetti! convinta e sicura che di acqua non ne entra e che il piede sarebbe ben al calduccio!!
"Qualità Beck.Internamente sono imbottiti, quindi indicati anche nelle stagioni più fredde (noi li utilizziamo con doppio calzino o con antiscivolo).Piede asciutto anche dopo mezz’ora nella neve.Il laccetto ha impedito alla neve di entrare da sopra."
"Sehr schöner Regenstiefel mit freundlichen Drachen. Sehr gut verarbeitet. Sehr angenehmes Warmfutter. Oben zum zusammenziehen. Habe sie eine Nummer größer bestellt, somit passt noch eine Lammfellsohle hinein. Tipptopp für die Übergangszeit. Mein Enkel ist happy!"
"Kein Verrutschen der Innensohle, einfach rein uns los geht's! Kind ist begeistert"
"Wir sind zufrieden. Wärmendes Innenfutter, trockene Füße."
"Sehr zufrieden, kann ich nur weiter empfehlen."
Die Größe ist wie angegeben und die Schuhe sind schön gefüttert.
Mon fils adore ses bottes.
"Me gusta mucho esta marca, principlamente por el piso o base de las zapatillas. Son diseños atemporales aunque los estampados de las telas pueden ser muy originales. En este caso he optado por unas zapatillas básicas en tono azul marino con un poco más de  altura en el piso ideales para el verano."
E da sottolineare che è inadeguato per bimbo di 15 mesi. Ma anche po grande. È altissimo e il bambino si storce la caviglia
"Fatte bene, veramente belle. Prezzo super.Peccato che sono un po piccole e scomode per una bambina. Quindi le sconsiglio o comunque sia consiglio un numero più grande"
Le scarpe sono come in foto e davvero carine ma eccessivamente grandi..consiglio di acquistare almeno un numero in meno se nn anche 2..
"Soy muy fan de las Superga y mis hijos siempre las llevan muy a gusto. Sin embargo, estas tienen una plataforma de 3 cm. que no es apta para niños pequeños. Mi hijo no podía caminar, parecía que llevara zancos."
Sono davvero stupende e calzano bene la mia bimba e super felice sembra una signorinella le consiglio a tutte 😊

"Sehr schicker Schuh, Plateau nicht zu hoch. Super"
Ultra comode
"Elles sont encore plus jolies en vrai... Bien blanches et avec une légère plateforme, ma fille les adore 😁"
Wieder einmal ein super bequemer und wunderschöner Schuh von Dr brinkmann nur zu empfehlen!!!
Loved it!
I was hoping these would be a shoe for standing and walking on concrete (my daily walk and work routine). Ughh! The fit is strange.  The size 12 is too small.  But the worst part is the inside construction.  Cheap.  The side curl in on themselves and are a pain to even work with to put on.  Skip it. Not worth the price.
"Ce ne sont pas mes premières New balance, habituellement je suis très satisfaite, par contre dans cet achat j’ai commandé du large, il est écrit large sur la boîte et dans les souliers et pourtant !!! Cette fois trop étroite bizarre ! J’ai été remboursé sans problème mais je suis déçue"
"Je l’utilise pour travailler. La semelle n’est pas forte donc, c’est un soulier qui ne durera pas des années. Mais le confort est parfait. C’est un soulier qui respire vraiment beaucoup."
"Modèle très léger et extrêmement souple et confortable! La couleur est plus que sympa. L’amorti est cependant assez limité. Je ne recommande pas ce modèle pour une activité sportive soutenue mais pour le quotidien et des marches en ville un peu sportives c’est un plaisir. L’été, vous sentirez le vent frais sur vos pieds! Je racherterai ce modèle tant qu’il sera en vente tant il est pratique. Vous entrez dans un élastique léger qui ferme naturellement la chaussure sur votre pied dans l’étouffer! Cela allège encore plus le modèle! Il faut l’essayer! Attention cependant à la taille, un petit 40 correspond à un 41 chez NB! Prenez Une taille au moins au dessus de votre pointure. Pour le reste, foncer les yeux fermés!"
Chaussures idéales pour l’entraînement en salle.
No Box but item was like brand new
Love these they are perfect for my needs!
"Wow, New Balance. Way to take a great shoe and completely ruin it. I was willing to overlook the awful color, but the design is even worse. The fabric upper will fall apart in no time, there is a tight seam RIGHT over the widest part of the foot, and will you STOP already with flat laces???? I bought in two colors and will be returning both of them. Last year’s model was just fine, WHY do you feel the need to reinvent the wheel every year? As a long-time devotee and proponent of the Minimus, this is making me regret recommending it to my personal training clients and will definitely send me out on the search for a new shoe. Thanks for nothing."
"These shoes are super light, super flexible, and oh-so comfy.  They a very minimal arch and heal support, but surprisingly my feet are not hurting.  I ordered a nine and they fit like a nine, lengthwise. I received a wide width by accident, and I have narrow feet, but the extra room is mostly in the toe box, which is GREAT!  I can spread by toes a little when I walk- I can tighten them over the bridge of the foot as loose or tight as I want.  I don't think I'll go back to normal width in this style/brand- it's that gooood.I work out in these (cross fit, HIIT, weightlifting), but I do not run in them."
"I usually wear 5.5 for dress shoes, I wear 6 in other brands; Nike.I own a pair of an older model of Minimus size 5.5 D, and love love love it, but for this model in size 5.5 D, my feet are kinda swimming in there.With thick socks it helps, but still love how my older model fit perfectly.Overall,they are well made. I use them exclusively in Zumba class. I've been through many pairs and many brands, for the past 5 years. Nike Free were my favorite pairs, but their bottom worn off too quickly, then when I tried Minimus I fell in love!I love that they are light. The bottom/sole are solid, yet flexible just enough. They have enough cushion for my liking and for what I use them for. The orange is a bit too bright for my liking, but it's on sale at the price I could afford.I just ordered another black pairs in black in size 5D, finger cross they fit better."
"Unsere Tochter (18M) liebt ihre Sandalen.Die Qualität der Schuhe ist sehr gut.Die Schuhe scheinen bequem zu sein, denn unsere Tochter mag sie manchmal gar nicht mehr ausziehen.Von uns Daumen hoch!"
"Grande. Comprate una misura meno. Mia figlia veste solo Geox, questa scarpa è risultata grande di una taglia."
"Schöner Schuh. Farbe ist wie abgebildet. Sohle ist für kleine Mäuse, die das Laufen noch lernen, gut geeignet. Gewohnte gute Qualität von Geox"
Llegó con un pequeño defecto pero no incómoda. Mi hija encanta salir con Geox sandalias. Recomiendo.
Zeer stevige en gemakkelijke  schoentjes
Schöner Schuh Größe passt auch
Son muy bonitas y bien de precio pero son muy anchas. A mi hija no le iban bien y las devolví
"Prodotto di qualità, conforme alle aspettative. Spedizione puntuale, venditore affidabile."
"Ces chaussures sont vraiment très bien, ma fille les adore, adoptées tout de suite sans ampoules ou autre. Le bout des pieds est protégé des bobos, ce qui chez nous est essentiel. Je recommande !"
Tous les jours  par beau temps
"I love Toms shoes. Most are very tight the first few times I worn. Then they stretch just a tad to be very comfortable. This particular shoe, for me, is not for long walks. The outside edge hits my ankle bone and after a while is not comfortable. For a day of errand running it’s no problem, but I wouldn’t walk a theme park in them."
I wish they had half sizes for it..i really liked the color
The foam is weird and squishy and uncomfortable.
I was so excited about these shoes but I cannot wear these. My foot will not slide in at all.  I also missed the return date.
Ordered a size 12 and they fit more like an 11.5 but was perfect for me.
"Kind of difficult to slip on without a shoe horn, but the padding is super comfortable!  Very pleased!"
The shoes are comfortable and can be worn most places. Easy on and off.
It was to hard of a shoe for me
It is very nice comfortable except that it was biting on my left toe. I think I need to try the wide 7.5 wide. I will return it and get the 7.5 wide.
"These Sketchers fit a little tight. No tying shoes. I can slip them on like sandals, almost, and go."
Needed initial stretching but now they fit great. I would not recommend them for working in or for workouts.
Start developing foot pain after walking every day. So disappointed on this shoes
Very nice shoes
Good quality. Great fit.
La caja llegó muy maltratada
"I’ve bought several pair of these and I do like them. They look great, are stylish but there is no support at all in the footbed and the toe area is quite narrow. I’m still giving them 4 stars because I do like them for running to the store or somewhere you won’t be on your feet for very long."
"I love these. They are so comfortable and light!!! Also love the color, looks like just like the picture! Also arrived way sooner then expected!!"
Very disappointing. Hardly any cushioning!
"So in love with the colors, and how comfortable they are! The memory foam soles are so nice."
"These shoes are so comfortable! I love how lightweight they are. I haven't done any walking in them yet, but I've been wearing them all day, am am pleased so far!"
Run a little big but love these!!!
"Run just a little big, “long”.  Toe box is great. Not as much arch support as previous ones ."
These are so cute. I got them for my mom for Christmas and her favorite color is purple so I think she will absolutely love these! Look and feel real. In an Adidas box but I can’t be 100%
"Lightweight, pretty colors, very comfy"
"The front of the shoe fits fine toes end up proper distance from the tip of the shoe, but the heel on these and theSkechers Men's EXPENDED-MANDEN Leather LACE UP Oxford, Charcoal, 8 Medium US  shoes to to big, and my heal slides up and down like a slipper.  7 and half's crush my feet.  8's just the heel portion is to loose.Overall would be comfortable, and look nice. But now got to find something to slide into the backside of the shoe.  I guess it's what I should expect finding these shoes over half off from retail price."
"Very comfortable shoe, well built, and sizes are right on. Not very warm, as shoes go....but I love the look and comfort. And a really good price...."
"I have purchased 4 pair of these shoes for my husband over the past several years.  He loves them! They fit perfectly,  support his feet and are light weight. Everything he expects from a good shoe!"
"I gave these as a Christmas gift to my husband, and he loves them.  He says they're very comfortable and have great support.  He has bought other Skechers shoes and so far these are perform ing as well as all the others."
Buen producto tallaje y material de acuerdo  a lo ofrecido
"muy cómodos, suaves al caminar, para practicar senderismo tienen buen agarre o para trotar"
Nicely made and the wide width is correct. The insoles are nice and comfy too.
Very comfortable and well made
Good value. Fits well.
Poor Quality.
When I saw these online it says they’re women shoes but when they was sent to me the box says unisex so they was way to large very misleading
"My foot doctor told me that if it is easy to bend a shoe, don't wear it.  This shoe is easy to bend with your hands, soft soles.  I have worn them over the past few months and am experiencing heel pain and lower back pain.  One week ago, I remembered what to look for and switched shoes and am already feeling better.  I can not recommend these shoes for walking, let alone running if you do that, I don't.  I do own other Reeboks which are perfectly fine, it is this particular model that is ... not good for me."
Cool shoe but these run mad bigI got 9.5 and they are men fitting shoes so technically i should’ve got a 8.5If the description was clear that they run by men sizes i would’ve known but it says these are women shoes so i got my regular sizeThey are too bigI don’t know who to give them too
"The media could not be loaded.
                




   This product came to me damaged, worn, dirty, and smelly! Not advertised as shown, literally a scam and will be reporting! Disgusted do not purchase these you will be disappointed"
The sneakers are really nice the colors and everything however the sizing is super super big. I ordered a size 7 and it was so big that I had to return it and order a 6 and the sixth was still a half-size big. If anyone orders the sneaker they have to order a size down or size of the house down
Too big but cute. Order half size down
"¡Excelente! Me encanta la calidad los compre para el hijo de mi novio y me dice que son cómodos para correr y para manejar bicicleta.De verdad que no tengo ninguna critica sobre este producto, ¡ME ENCANTARON!"
Son grandes  talla 6 es talla 7 o dependiendo  de la persona  pero yo soy  6 y están grande
They run a little large to me. I wanted them for walking but I only wore them once and they rubbed against the back of my ankle and caused bleeding.
The product was much too large for my wife.  She normally wears a size 8 but these seemed to be perhaps a man's size 8.  Way too long.  They have been returned.
La misura è perfetta. Sono comode e per l'estate le ricompro sempre alle mie bambine sono l'alternativa alla scarpa aperta. Mi ricordano la mia infanzia. :)
"Ho acquistato questa scarpa convinta che fosse color indaco, in realtà è più un blu elettrico.Nel complesso comunque sono soddisfatta sia a livello di materiale che di comodità."
"esattamente come me le aspettavo, calzano perfettamente, colore come da foto, consegna rapidissima. ottime perchè senza lacci, di facile inserimento al piede. pienamente soddisfatta... anche mio figlio!"
Aspettativa rispettata.
"Spedizione veloce, prodotto di ottima qualità e molto veritiera in base alle foto. Io sono soddisfatta continuerò a comprare sicuramente"
"Mon fils de bientôt 5 ans les trouve lourdes aux pieds et plutôt inconfortables. Décue, je vais les retourner rapidement."
"Très chouette basket, j'avais déjà acheté une paire pour ma fille l'année dernière. Elles sont très pratiques et très solides!"
Groesse ist passend. Kann sehr gut privat getragen werden. Passen farblich auch gut zu bräunen chaps. Fuesse schwitzen nicht so stark als in Gummischuhen.
"I bought the shoes, the exact same model, because the 1st pair ""died"" after more than 5 years. I really like them. I washed them in the washing machine and the color never changed."
"El diseño es muy bueno, sientan muy bien al pie y son cómodos, lucen bien y sólo recomendaría no atarlo muy fuerte, si tiene n algún problema con sus pies, porque aprietan bastante, que se siente como si estuvieran bloqueando las venas del empeine. Por todo lo demás, muy buena compra a un precio de liquidación."
"Lo único que no me gustó de esta experiencia es que la fecha de entrega estaba para casi mes, llegaron mucho antes de lo esperado, en buenas condiciones y tal cual la descripción. Unos tenís excelentes y el diseño muy bonito, los puedes usar cómo tenis casual, para el gimnasio y del diario."
"Me ha llegado de Estados Unidos y en otro color del que pedí, en blanco concretamente pero igual me gustaron y por no devolverlas y todo el jaleo me las quede,van muy bien. Me llamaron de la aduana y tuve que enviar la factura de compra..."
"Die Farbe des Schuhes ist für Sonnenschein gedacht , habe den Schuh noch nicht getragen und warte auf die Sonne ! Der Schuh entspricht meinen Erwartungen!"
Parfait
Great product no problems
"I gave these shoes 4 out of 5 stars because of the insoles.  I have sensitive feet, am on my feet quite a bit throughout the day, and have a bad back so I’m critical about my footwear and often purchase premium insoles for my most worn shoes, boots, and even my house slippers.  The shoes themselves are excellent - ASICS gel never disappoints!  These have a very breathable construction to prevent foot sweating (and future stink) that some shoes may not provide.  My feet sweat more than the average joe so I consider breathable construction critical as well.  I love the color choices and the one I chose looks great with a pair of jeans and  a t-shirt and are not a total eye catcher.  Some women with a big bust may be able to relate to this similarity.  Sure, it’s great to show off and look good, but I like a fairly modest look.  If you are looking for a great brand of tennis shoes that are durable, lasting, colorful, comfortable, and cozy, consider ASICS gel brand shoes.  For those of you with lower back pain who visit chiropractors whom do mention finding a comfortable pair of footwear and insoles, I have not tried much but the Dr. School’s branded insoles.  They have several types and the packaging is designed where a buyer can squeeze the insoles anf feel the material they are made of.  Anyway, these shoes are not the first pair of ASICS gel shoes I have owned over the years and they do not disappoint.  If I had a kid, I would bring him or her up in ASICS for sure- and perhaps some cute looking gorilla slippers or maybe even some of those shoes that resemble lizard feet and “growl” when the kids stomp their feet.  I also like Nike Air, Sketchers, and k-Swiss “tubbers”.  They are also kind to a middle-aged man wit s bit of back pain.  Lift with your knees, wear comfortable shoes, stretch a couple minutes in bed when you first wake up, don’t sit on a huge wallet that makes you bum uncomfortable, take it easy, and visit a chiropractor twice within a week when back problems become an issue and you’ll be happy.  It wouldn’t hurt getting a massage either from time to time either.  Oh, and be critical on the chairs you sit on often and adjust your automobile lumbar support properly too.  You can do a lot of little things on your own like that and they even sell automobile seat mats that massage your butt and back too.  But yeah, a good pair of shoes is top on the list and ASICS gel does not disappoint!"
"I love Asics and have been wearing them for like 20+ years. I'm a huge fan of the Kayano series. So when I saw these, I was very intrigued. I wear them for the gym and they're great for it—I wouldn't recommend running for long distances in them like regular Kayanos—because they're a lot stiffer.Only reason why I gave it four stars is because the sole/tread seems to be made of a different, slicker material. So when you walk outside on wet surfaces, it's much more slippery than any other Asics I've had—much less other regular Kayanos.Otherwise, it's a great shoe for the gym because of the tread pattern under the arch. Love the design and looks of it too."
"I bought these as my regular running shoes. I usually wear size 11.5 but upon trying these decided that the extra room might be causing extra movement leading to a burning sensation and ultimately, blisters on my little toes. I then exchanged them for size 11 which feel snug and good initially. The padding is thick and feels very cushioned on walking or running. However, after about 45 mins and 5 miles of running, my feet like they are on fire. My little toes have been getting painful blisters. I think the inner material is causing a lot of friction and heat buildup. I tried giving them a chance and had them for a month or so but I am going to go back to my older climacool Adidas that have perforated soles and have never given me any problems."
"I've had these shoes for a while now. I wore along with other asics without the gell.Oh my gosh! Gell does so much! Feels amazing. Honestly first few steps on these always feels delightful 😊I'm pretty cheap when it comes to buying stuff. But I'd get these again as long as they're not $80 or above (can't ever justify $80 shoes in my head, even if they are amazing). And if they were under $70 I'd get them every time. Wouldn't even bother looking at other shoes."
"Scarpe davvero molto belle. Le ho prese per una femminuccia, ma temevo che fossero più da maschio, ma sono tanto belle che vanno bene per tutti."
"Bonitas, cómodas y útiles. 👌🏼"
Comoda e asciutta
"Mi hijo está encantado, bonitos cómodos y resistentes al agua."
Scarpe molto leggere e confortevoli.  Assolutamente  waterproof
My son likes them. They are ridgid fabric but are still nice and light weight. They have kept my little puddle stompers feet dry walking into school and through parking lots. I gave them a pretty good soaking rinsing some mud off and they seemed dry inside still.
Love skechers! Cool colors and light weight.
My son loves these shoes!
My son loved his new sneakers.
"I like the fact that they are Adidas, which I’ve always had good luck with.  These shoes are used for outdoor pickleball.  The look of the shoe is not what I expected.  The entire white part of the shoe above the laces looks huge.  I’ll wear them, but there’s more than enough room in the toe area.  My size is 8 and they look like 10’s.  Too late to return them as I wore them once.  Next time my purchase will be through Amazon."
"Fit fairly true to size, and are comfortable. My previous pair held up for 4 ish months, with me playing about 3x a week, sometimes 4+ hours at a time. (They've still got life in them and are currently my back ups).They do not breathe well. I take them off between games or sets and it kind of helps but not really. Haven't really had this issue in other shoes, but these ones are much more comfortable than others!"
These are the most comfortable shoes I've worn for athletics. They are very soft-soled and they are not good if you need ankle support.
Great blend of performance and comfort. This shoe offers great support without all of the bulkiness.
These adidas court shoes felt great at first. The no tongue fitted sock stretched out over a couple of weeks of a lot of tennis. This caused my foot to slide around more.
"I like these shoes, but they aren't everything I had hoped and dreamed of. They're not incredibly cushy but are functional walking shoes. I wouldn't recommend running in them though"
"Was overdue for a pair and these I have really been liking - Great padding, lightweight and supportive.  Makes playing time on the court comfortable and enjoyable!"
"Fits as expected, looks cute"
I really love these shoes. My foot is wide at the instep and they fit well without rubbing.
"Great shoe - roomy toe box, great arch support.  My feet are thanking me."
"Le scarpe soddisfano le mie aspettative. Calzano piccole, quindi invece del 38 che è il numero che acquisto per altri modelli di altre marche ho acquistato 38,5, ma il 39 sarebbe andato meglio."
"Scarpe bellissime tutte bianche. Taglia perfetta, ho preso un numero in più come consigliatomi, e sono perfette. Consegna puntuale, che dire il TOP"
"IL TOP , PRIMA VOLTA COME MODELLO , IO DI SOLITO COMPRO SAUCONY JAZZ, ORMAI DA 5 ANNI , HO VOLUTO CAMBIARE MODELLO , ECCELENTE."
Design e fattura della scarpa hanno soddisfatto le attese

"These are great. Super easy for my 3 year old to take off and on by himself (which is always the goal, right?)"
COOL BOOTS
Nice
Gran calidad. Excelente talle.
These may not be the best for player practicing 3 to 5 times a week but can do the job for occasional player.
"good support, nice shoe"
"I mean, these are Converse. You know how they'll fit, you know how they'll look. They're authentic and casual. The perfect shoe. God bless you, Converse. Damn you for making me pay $50 for canvas with a flat rubber bottom. But bless you for giving me 75% of my footwear wardrobe."
The pair which was received had white cat hair all over the outside and inside of one of the shoes. It appears that they were a returned pair and were not inspected when returned to the seller. I cleaned them with a lint remover and there as good as brand new.
"Great shoes and easy to pick a size once I realized they were in men's sizes. Before shipping, the seller contacted me to confirm the shoe size I chose, which I found very considerate. Definitely a great buy."
Exelente producto
Can't go wrong with the classic Chuck!
My daughter was very happy to receive these on Christmas morning!
I bought it for my granddaughter as a Christmas gift.The product looks fine.I will find out after the holidays.

"Sono le mie seconde geox acquistate su amazon e sono molto soddisfatto. Prezzo vantaggioso rispetto ai negozi e concorrenziali rispetto ad altri brand anche di fascia medio-bassa. Calzano larghe quindi meglio prendere un numero in meno, ma preferisco avere scarpe un po` abbondanti ma comode piuttosto che troppo strette. Look casual ed eleganti allo stesso tempo. Le consiglio senza riserve."
"Acquisto sempre geox...questo modello mi ha colpito tanto.La scarpa è leggera, calda, impermeabile.Qualità/prezzo il top!Consiglio vivamente questo paio di scarpe!"
"A mi en lo personal me encantan los zapatos Geox, por su calidad, diseños y confort al usarlos. Estos nuevos que ordené satisfacen los esperaba de ellos. Son muy cómodos al usarlos desde la primera vez.. me encantan"

scarpe corrispondenti alla descrizione.
Geox is always good.

"Corro già da qualche anno, con un discreto livello fino ad un mezza maratona. Ho sempre usato brooks, e questa scarpe mi hanno permesso di fare ancora un salto di qualità, premetto che corro solo su strada asfaltata o al massimo qualche leggero sterrato e con queste ora tengo medie di 4:00-4:30 al km. Leggerissime super reattive e anche dopo tanti km non si sente tanto la stanchezza come le precedenti. Consigliatissime!"
"Bisher hatte ich viel zu Schwere Mizunos, die ich aber auch sehr möchte. Seit dem ich den Brooks habe will ich die Mizunos nicht mehr anziehen. Normalerweise trage ich Größe 44, bei diesem Schuh passte 45,5 perfekt"
"One of the better running shoes you can buy super light, great return, bouncy and very generous cushioning, keeps your feet pain-free. Great for speed workouts and long runs. Ideal for wide footers."
"Very light weight but still durable. Great for tempo training.Only dislike is the price, there are more affordable shoes out there."
"leggere ma comode, reattive e veloci"
"Perfect size, delivery on time, shoe looks really nice. Ready to hit the streets! Very satisfied"
Ideali per allenamenti veloci e medi
"Chaussures exceptionnelles , des plumes aux pied qui transforme la course en vol à voile"
"Put 30mi on them so far and they've been very light, comfortable and sturdy! I tried the levitate and ghost at the same time, but they didn't compare to these."
"Love these shoes! Very light weight, but they absorb the shock extremely well. I will most certainly purchase these shoes again. They're my new favorites!"
La qualité est là malheureusement l’élastique comprime le pied de la fille au niveau du coup de pied.. dommage
"Nuevo a estrenar, sandalias bonitas pero Amazon las entrega sin caja, al menos enMi caso, no se me informa de nada y llegan en la simple bolsa de plástico de reparto de Amazon, la verdad q muy mal en ese aspecto porque son para regalar y así parecen falsas… aunque no lo son"
"My 8 years old kiddo loves it. She wears 1US so I ordered the same size. It was right in time to wear, no extras for the future, but that's OK. The sandals look nice and are very comfortable."
Bonitos y de calidad
"Die Schuhe passen gut, aber das Anziehen ist für meinen Sohn etwas schwierig, da man sie gut weiten muss um bequem hineinzukommen. Leider sind sie aber nicht wasserdicht!!! Auch nach der Imprägnierung kommt noch Wasser durch und die Socken sind leicht nass, obwohl die Schuhe nur 2 Stunden im Schnee getragen worden sind. Schade, denn die Wasserdichtigkeit war meine Kaufentscheidung."
"Leider hält der Schuh nicht was er verspricht. Nach 4 mal tragen war der schuh klitschnass innen und überhauptnicht wasserdicht. Da erwarte ich von 80 Euro Schuhen was anderes, auch bei Matschwetter.Gleichzeitig zerstört der untere Klettverschluss das Material des Stiefels, da dieser direkt aufliegt.Die Schuhe werde ich zurück schicken."
My girls can't even wear them. They are a size too small.
Nice material but the pants were too long and baggy for me. May be better suited for someone taller than 5’7 with long legs.
great
At first I bought a size too small for my nephew so I asked for an exchange which came pretty fast. The fit was perfect and my nephew love it. I kinda wish the inside had a bit more cushion tho but apart from that the sandals are great. Good quality too
Très satisfaite et livraison très rapide
"ma fille les adorent, elle qui chausse du 2 normalement le 3 fit parfait"
Great adidas flip flop for the price
We got these May 27 for our son and they have already came right apart! I would like to return but missed the window by a few days :(
Exactly as in store. 4 stars as they cause some discomfort.
Très large
Great price and fits to size perfectly!!
"We own 4 pairs of Adissage slides in our family. After one of the kids lost hers, she's been begging about a replacement. These seem different than the other pairs we own. The logo on the heel is different -see  the Adidas website for comparison. They are much lighter. The the nubs  on the footbed are shorter and more blunt. The annoying part is the top band is pushed too far back from the toe, which makes your toes really stick out.  We are keeping these, but next time will stick to the originals as the fit appears more comfortable."
"I wish I had read others reviews before buying, but since my son already owned and loved a pair, I didn’t even think twice before sizing up. THESE ARE NOT THE SAME as they used to be made. See my pics of old vs new. In fact, when I opened them up, I thought I got cheap €hin@ knockoffs. They are so thin, the sole feels like a dollar store shoe quality, and the nubs are duller. Also, these seem much wider than the originals. Adidas has done their customers wrong by changing the quality!!! My son won’t let me return them because he loves his other pair so much he wants them again, but I have a feeling the quality will not outlive his shoe size this time and we’ll definitely be buying a different brand next time."
These seemed fake as soon as they came out of the torn up box. Purchased a 6 wide which is my normal size in NB and there were super tight and small. The sole is not attached to the shoe and comes off without any effort and the seams are odd. I’m not sure if they are fake or just very poorly made unlike the other nb shoes I always wear.
"Der Schuh ist extrem leicht und angenehm zu tragen, hätte allerdings eine Nummer größer bestellen können.....trage 40 und stoße bei diesem Modell schon vorne dicht an, geht aber noch, da das Material sehr weich und angehem ist....Mal sehen, wie's bei längeren Strecken wird 😅"
Me encantaron súper cómodos lo que si un poco pesados es de esperarse por la suela pero te acostumbras .. definitivo no para correr pero para hacer pesas o elípticas geniales
Very comfortable easy to put on and off
"These sneakers are super comfortable!! I purchased the grey color! Love them! Everyone said they ran super small & some even got two sizes bigger than their regular size... I’m usually a 7.5-8 in any shoe. I usually buy a 7.5 in sneakers, size 8 in boots for a tiny extra room. I purchased these sneakers in a size 8 & they fit exactly perfect!! Not small, not large. My correct size. Thank you!"
I am normally a size 7.5 and I decided to order a 9.5 because everyone was saying they come too small to size up. and yes!!! the 9.5 fit perfect.. they are super white on a sunny day and in pictures. love them and super comfortable too.
"The shoes are so beautiful and I would have loved to wear them but they are extremely small. I got a 9.5, which I usually am. But I feel as though I’d have to go up to a 10.5..."
"I have Addidas that are size 7, 7.5 and 8 and they all fit, so it's a hard product to buy online. Having said that, these run very small: I had to pay shipping to return, and the bag was not reusable so I had to buy a large one at the UPS shipping spot, so it cost me over $10 to send these back. Won't make make the same mistake again. (I was disappointed because, otherwise, super nice shoe.)"
"I originally purchased the Steve Madden Maxima in grey from their site and found they run super small. After sizing up a whole size (7.5-8.5), they were still too small. Dealing with lengthy returns and stocking issues, I came over to Amazon and found these. They looked similar in style and sole, so I went up 2 sizes (7.5-9.5) and they finally fit. They’re cute and so far, comfy, but do end up actually “looking” bigger which is different, but they work.I was mainly looking for a grey pair of shoes for work. These are certainly that, but the sizing is truly wild!"
"Granted, I have wide feet, but they were definitely on the narrow side. No arch support. Felt like they'd be comfortable if they fit though!"
"Omg very confortable shoes, my mother recommend this shoes and in happy i purchased this pair"
"Ein sehr schöner, sehr gut verarbeiteter Sneaker der aber eine volle Größe größer ausfällt, deswegen unbedingt eine Nummer kleiner bestellen."
"Top Schuhe, sehen unheimlich süß aus am Kinderfuß. Der Einstieg ist etwas eng, aber am schmalen Fuß aber sogar barfuß bequem."
"Schöner Schuh,  aber leider nur für schmale Füsse geeignet."
Sólo reseñar que el arco de la parte interna del pie está bastante elevado y si la niña tiene el pie un poco ancho (como mi hija) le va a hacer daño.La sandalia es buena pero sería mejor poder probarla antes porque a muchas niñas no le va a quedar bien.
"Sandalia que talla un poco grande, pero muy bonita (a la niña le encanta la unión del blanco y el brilli brilli)  muy cómoda. Han sido las sandalias que se ha puesto mi hija toooooodo el verano, y todavía les queda tralla... Antes de que las destroce llegará el invierno y no se las podrá poner.  Por mí, un gran acierto de compra, y mucho más por el precio (las cogí con oferta)."
"Es el segundo par que compro de este modelo. Los lleva mi hija mayor y al ver el buen resultado, también se las he comprado a la pequeña.Calidad Pablosky a un precio inmejorable.Y ellas dicen que son comodísimas"
Sandalias muy cómodas y suela de buena calidad. Las correas se ponen feas al poco tiempo y se deshilachan. Me gusta porque son respetuosas con el pie del niño aunque se estropean pronto no les duran más de unos meses por el crecimiento.
Poco que decir que no se sepa de la calidad de Pablosky. Mi hija de cuatro años ha estado usando las sandalias todo el verano y ninguna queja. Por su precio son muy elegantes y cómodas.
Super cómodas desde el principio. Ni una rozadura en la piel;además són súper bonitas y el número se ajusta a la perfección.
"Bonjour,Je suis très déçue, j'ai reçu ces chaussures pour ma fille le 27 mai, esthétique très bien, qualité de prime abord idem. Mais à l'usage grande désillusion, après les avoir porté 4 fois pour sortir faire des achats, donc quelques heures, et non pas des journées complètes, voici le résultat, en plein milieu du magasin la boucle qui retient la bride s'est décrochée, en effet comme vous pouvez le voir ça c'est déchiré le long de la couture de façon bien nette. En plus avec la chaleur les parties collées sur la semelle en liège se décollent.A ce prix j'aurai espéré qu'elles tiennent une saison....."
La horma sobresale mucho en el puente y leha hecho rozaduras. No las volvería a comprar.
Super anchas! Y eso que mi hija tiene empeine y el pie ancho. Las tuve que devolver
"Sin duda son geniales como todos los productos de pablosky.Recomendable,  mi hija tiene pue fino y no es grande."
This is the second pair that I bought as a back up because my feet are very small and it’s hard to find shoes that fit right and I like these very much and they’re very comfortable
"I am a bit over 50yo and I have probably owned a grand total of five or six pairs of boots during my life. This is a very small number of boots given I grew up where we consistently had snow cover during the winter. I have worn each pair of those boots, maybe, a maximum of three or four times each before chucking them out even though they were all 'good quality' boots and in excellent shape. I found that the slip-on boots quickly became loose, the ones with many eyelets took me forever to put on and take off and the ones with only a few eyelets never really felt they were on quite right. I can also say they were all uniformly pretty uncomfortable, particularly when you consider I would rather have cold, wet, feet in freezing temperatures then wear those boots. That really should tell you something. Anyway a few years back I moved to a place in country Victoria, Australia. Although it is not quite as wet and as cold as where I grew up, I do often end up traipsing through sodden fields and forests. Early onset senility must have begun to set in, because, after having wasted so much money boots in the past, I thought it would be a good idea to waste some more money on a new pair I would hate. After spending what seemed like a week on the internet looking at boots 24/7, I finally settled on a pair of ECCO Jamestown Hydromax Chukka's. Simply put, they are unbelievably comfortable, such that they have only come off when I have showered or slept. This is despite having more than half-a-dozen more appropriate and expensive pairs of shoes/slippers for whatever it was I was doing at the time for which boots really the footwear for the job. I really can not recommend these boots highly enough."
They look great and are comfortable. Only issue is they are loose around heel and ankle and I bought a size smaller than I usually wear. I put better insoles to fill the space.
This boot like all Ecco products are comfortable and tough and durable while fashionable.  IMPORTANT : They run an entire size too large.  I wear 12s but had to exchange for 11s.  I’ve never had to do this but they definitely run too large in American sizes
"Metric Size 46 says  12 to 12-1/2. that is right on. If you wear an 11-1/2, get the next size down.The heal adds about 1/2"" more rise that the toe.Got them for ranch wear, but nice enough for dress."
Have worn this pair two times. They fit and feel great. I have worn ECCO shoes and boots for twenty years. My next pair of shoes will be ECCO.
Feel like a 10.5
Good fitting comfortable lightweight boot
Good lightweight boot
"Great shoe, great fit, a no brainer buy."
Très joli par contre taille un peu grand
"Restituite a causa della puzza emessa dalla suola: il tipico odore ""chimico"" che si sente nei negozi di prodotti fabbricati in Cina, per fortuna la richiesta di reso è stata accettata. Le scarpe erano belle ed anche comode ma l'odore era intollerabile e sospetto che non faccia affatto bene esporsi a queste sotanze."
"Scarpe con ottimo rapporto qualità-prezzo. Vestono la taglia abituale delle scarpe da tennis. Sono comode dal primo utilizzo, pratiche e anche belle da passeggio. Acquisto favoloso!"
"Comode , taglia giusta e spedizione impeccabile"
Super laufschuhe!! Ich nehme immer die selbe und sind bequem.  Die nutze bei Handball Spielen und sind sehr stabil und leicht.
Perfette! Comodissime e leggere!
"Granddaughter's new favorite shoes.  Nice looking, good fit for her narrow foot."
"Musste mir diesen Schuh in 3 Größen bestellen um dann schlussendlich bei einer 42 (normal 40) zu landen. Vom Tragekomfort her empfehle ich bei den ersten ""Tragversuchen"" gleich Pflaster an die  knöchel zu kleben, da ich mir meine schon nach einer halben std blutig gerieben habe. Nach 3* tragen finde ich sie mittlerweile bequem und kann auch 8h damit arbeiten. Sie fühlen sich am Fuß etwas schwer an, liegt wahrscheinlich an der harten Sohle. Alles in allem ist es ein sehr schöner Schuh der nur etwas Einkauf braucht."
"Was Material, Aussehen betreffen - alles super. Aber wer hier die Größen festlegte, keine Ahnung! Das erste Mal bestellte ich gleich die Gr. 39, weil ich die Hinweise las. Ich trage eigentlich 38.Doch auch 39 war zu klein, wenn auch nur wenig. Also musste ich die 39 zurück schicken. Vorsichtshalber bestellt ich dann 39,5 und 40. Und! 39,5 war perfekt."
"Ein wirklich schöner Schuh,das Material ist edel und gut verarbeitet. leider passt er überhaupt nicht. Deshalb leider zurück"
"Der Schuh sieht richtig gut aus. Sehr weiches Leder aber leider fallen sie kleiner aus.Ich habe normalerweise Größe 38,5 und die Größe 39 bestellt. War trotzdem noch etwas zu eng. Schade, Schuh ging zurück."
"Mir gefällt dieser Schuh sehr. Er fällt etwas kleiner aus, deswegen habe ich ihn eine halbe Größe größer bestellt. Und nun passt er perfekt. Ich hoffe ich kann ihn noch lange tragen. Optisch sehr schön. Das Leder macht auch einen guten Eindruck. Daumen hoch. Würde ich wieder kaufen."
"Der Schuh ist gut verarbeitet, das Leder ist weich, die Innensohle kann herausgenommen werden. Hatte mir andere Rezensionen durchgelesen und schließe mich der Meinung an, dass der Schuh klein ausfällt. Deshalb habe ich statt meiner üblichen 37,5-38 den Schuh in 39,5 bestellt und Größe passt perfekt."
"Ich trage sonst 38/39 und musste ihn auch größer bestellen, da er sonst zu eng war, ansonsten ein toller stylischer Schuh der auch noch sehr bequem und nicht so steif ist. Durch die Lasche an der Ferse lässt er sich zudem total leicht anziehen (auch wenn die Schnürsenkel nicht geöffnet sind)."
"Die sind mega schön, fallen klein aus.. Aber ich werde mich reinzwängen 😂"
Sehr klein mindestens zwei Nummern größer bestellen.
"Schade, sehen gut aus aber sind zu klein.Ich habe Gr. 36,5 und bestelle immer Gr. 37. Diese sind mir zu klein."
"Taille adéquate.Forme très sympa, et malgré ce que je croyais ça ne fait pas un pieds trop large. Je ne les ai pas encore beaucoup portées vu la chaleur donc je ne peux en dire plus pour l’instan!"
Rien de particulier à dire. Pataugas est une valeur sûre.
Ne m'ont pas plus
Très belles baskets. On est très bien dedans. La fermeture éclair est très pratique. Super élégantes car basket fine. Ravie de mon cadeau!!!
Parfait
"Bella scarpa ,  leggera , morbida , numero corrispondente ai numeri italiani , per ora ho levato una stella per fatto che al interno sembra che ha un grado di usura molto , forse tropo veloce , questo dopo qualche settimana di usura normale di una ragazzina , se peggiora tornerò a aggiornare ."
"Ottimo prodotto. Belle, raffinate e versatili. Comode e di buona fattura. Inizialmente ho ordinato 39 (il mio numero abituale) ma erano palesemente strette e ho sostituito con il 40. Perfette!"
El producto es prácticamente dos tallas más pequeñas que la talla que utilizas.
"Los cogí en oferta, parecen de buena calidad, pero a mí me tallaron pequeños, al final se los quedó un familiar ( está encantada con ellas)"
Muy bonitos y cómodos! Los recomiendo!
"Habe die Schuhe in der Größe  44 für einen top Preis bestellt.Musste leider feststellen das Größe 44 eigentlich Gr.43 ist,sie sind kürzer als meine anderen ART SCHUHE in Gr.44.Habe die Schuhe von der Marke das allererstemal zurückgeben müssen."
Those shoes are ridiculous narrow!!!
"Good looking shoes, my two sons used them for holiday shoes, I was concerned that they were going to hurt their feet since they’re not used to wear this type of shoes but they’ve use them now couple of times and they seem to be comfortable, no marks on their feet"
"Buenos zapatos, esta marca nunca falla"
Muy suaves y muy buena calidad
Le e devuelto por que le estaba pequeño..pero coji un nr más grande y fenomenal
Le queda perfecto.
Super chaussures 💕💕💕
Love the shoes but for me they weren't as comfortable as I had hoped! But I will look for insoles and hopefully they will be comfy! Over all I am still happy with the shoes!
"These are the cutest shoes ... and very comfy I might add. They have great arch support for those that need it. The colors are great. These shoes are very narrow, perfect for me though as read other reviews saying they were!"
Everyday wear . Fits well and very cute
Neat design that goes well with my black and white work uniform. Good arch support—can walk for miles in the hallways without back or leg pain.
Great looking shoe.  Correct size 8-1/2 too tight on top of foot & heel too loose.
Love them!
I like the sneaker
"Producto malo,muy malo.Hace mucho daño,es incómodo,mala calidad. Un error comprar esto. No volveré a picar. No merece la pena,para nada."
Great shoe
"Bellissime!!!! Arrivate prestissimo, sandalino bello, comodo e morbidissimo, consigliato!!!!"
"bonitas, funcionales, duraderas y comodisimas."
"Prese per mio figlio, da indossare quotidianamente. Hanno resistito alla grande tutto l’inverno e oltre, sono comode e facili da mettere e togliere anche in autonomia. Ottimo acquisto."
"Scarpe stupende, molto leggere, calde, veramente ben fatte. Le riacquisterò nella versione blu. Sono anche calde. Consigliatissime. Il venditore é serissimo, acquistate domenica pomeriggio, domenica sera già spedite, il martedì era già ai piedi di mio figlio"
Bellissime e comode come sempre.
"Ottima scarpa confortevole calda, morbida ed Impermeabile acquisto ottimo lo consiglio"
Scarso. Usate per andare da casa a scuola e non sono arrivate a fine stagione.
"Qualità buona, il prodotto rispecchia la qualità del marchio."
Sembrano belle
These are good if you're looking for an entry-level Sprint Spike. Reason I only give it three stars though is because the strike plate is not solid across the bottom. It is rubber and can bend through the arch and heel. This makes it good for a 400m but not for a 100 and 200 meter race. In a 100 and 200m race having a solid strike plate through the heel Forces you to stay on your toes. It is a lot harder to stay on your toes all the way through 400 race. So the flexion in this strike plate being made of soft rubber allows the heel to flex and touch the ground. But I needed a shoe for a shorter Sprint that has a solid strike plate all the way through to the heel.
"My son had these same shoes last year and he decided to get another pair this year for track. While I’ve never worn them, my 8th grader really likes them. Snug fit."
The shoes look great.  Nice feel to them. Made from Adidas.  These are being shipped overseas to my nephew's in the Philippines.  Love the material.
My Son won his Frist 100m dash of the track season.👍🏾🥇
Bought them for my son. Fit well and he really liked them.
"Fit as expected, good price especially for beginner runners."
"Love this brand and model, recommend to any track runner on a competitive team!"
"I purchased these for my son to run sprints, relays, and hurdles and he looooove them."
The shoe is poorly made and the outsole seperated after one sprinting event
The spikes were an exact fir and perform very well
"Dieser Schuh ist eine Klasse für sich, sehr wertig. Perfekte Verarbeitung. Dementsprechender Preis. Den hätte ich sogar gezahlt. ..  Aber: Obwohl schon 1 1/2 Nummern größer bestellt als normal, immer noch viel zu klein. Was soll das? Wozu sind Größenangaben da? Dass man die Schuhe 3x bestellt? Mache ich nicht mit, die mangelnde Nachhaltigkeit durch überflüssige Versandprozesse ist ein Ausschlusskriterium"
"A falta de probarlas en las condiciones de nieve y frío, parecen de muy buena calidad, espero tener botas para mucho tiempo."
de talla un poco grande
"These are, as I like to think, the shoes that DeWalt would make if they made shoes. They feel like they are made to come with a drill. They were good in winter in London and not at all sweaty or too hot. They had good grip and stood up to puddles and walks in the city and the country. I personally put other inner soles inside but that’s my preference with most shoes. I did take them for a spin in California before I left to London and I will say that they felt a bit gammy under those conditions. They are not very breathable. However, if you are headed somewhere where it’s mostly miserable, you will be quite happy. Just don’t wear them on a date."
"Bought this as I needed a wide shoe (for a bunion), that is also waterproof, for work.  Although I work part time, I'm on my feet almost the entire time.  This shoe is very comfortable and haven't needed to put an insert in for additional support.  Shoe was exposed to water and it did not allow moisture to come through."
I was very surprised to feel that this shoe in 10 Wide felt narrower than my other Columbia boots in 10 regular. I can't comment on any other aspect of the footwear as I could not wear them and they were returned immediately.
"Best shoes I have owned in a long time. Very comfortable, will be buying another pair when these wear out."
Very well made waterproof sneaker. My son has autism and constantly jumps...these sneakers are able to withstand.
nice
2e Wide' is not wide at all
Cómodo para los niños. La talla según la esperada. Buena calidad
conforme au descriptif. bonne qualité comme d'habitude avec Geox
"Chaussures très jolies mais qui s’abiment dès la première utilisation au niveau de la pliure du pied sur les côtés. Extrêmement déçue par la marque, aussi bien ma fille que moi nous n’usons pas nos chaussures, celle la, elles sont bonnes pour la poubelle en très peu d’utilisation. Vu le prix de base des chaussures ça fait mal au cœur d’avoir des chaussures à usage unique. @Victoria s’est loupé dans la fabrication de ce modèle. Nous l’avons en gris et en noir toutes les 2, je regrette vraiment mes achats."
"Más bonitas que en la foto, tienen mucho brillo sin resultar cursis a la niña le encantan, tallan grandecitas, si se quieren para usar ya yo pediría un número menos del habitual, un 31 de estas es como un 32 de muchas otras"
Stupende ben fatte alla moda comode e vestono bene quindi non sono strette nemmeno come pianta . La marca non si smentisce
"Mucho más bonitas en la realidad, eran para regalo. Recomendables."
los volvería a comprar
Perfectas
"Optisch sieht der Stiefel toll aus. Ich habe die Stiefel für den Winter für meine 10jährige Tochter gekauft. Sie sind warm an den Füßen. Jedoch halten sie einem Tag im Schnee nicht stand. Meine Tochter hatte nach ca. 2 Stunden Schlitten fahren nasse Füße. Für den Fußweg zur Schule im Winter okay, aber für den Schneespaß nicht gebrauchbar."
Zu klein obwohl 1 Nummer größer als sonst
Roza en el talón
"A favorite among 20 or so boost models I have.I am a solid size 11 in all other Boost models but required a 10.5 in these. You may like your regular sizeif you prefer 3/8"" or so in front of your big toe. In addition the toe box is very roomy.A stiffer nylon fabric than other boost models, not stretchy.  Quality supple leather helps tone done the silverlook a bit and thinking it may be pigskin.Lots of squish as a casual kick, second to the Arsham model. Those beat out all if that is what you are lookingfor.Can't speak to the performance of the shoe for any activities only as a great choice for long periods of standingand or walking.Quality build, will pick-up in another color."
"De verdad tenía un poco de miedo al pedirlas con mi talla, porque no estaba seguro como viene en tamaño.Pero muy satisfecho me encantan que tiene esa reflexión con las luces de noche."
Really like these shoes. Feels like I’m walking on a cloud.
En la publicación muestran unos zapatos y me llegaron otros totalmente diferentes
"I fnove these shoes.  I have bought various styles and they are all great, however these can be seen from space, let alone at night 🌌🚀🌌🚀"
Description the same picture isnt.
Do not purchase this! The picture advertised is not the same as the product you will receive. Incorrect sizing seems to be another issue also. Stay away!
I hope Adidas won't discontinue these.  I would love to add more tomy closet!
Great fit and very comfortable
Very much what I expected comfortable shoe cool color way
"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Sarò breve: queste Scarpe ""Kappa"" sono molto belle a vedersi e davvero comode (ho preso il 40 e calza alla perfezione). Serve aggiungere altro…?⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"Buenos acabados y estética pero tienen la pisada muy dura no las recomiendo para correr,para pasear aún pero hay mejores opciones la verdad"
"Son como en la foto, muy bonitas y cómodas.Las he usado un tiempo ya y son geniales.Recomendadas 100%"
"Die Schuhe entsprechen voll den Erwartungen.  Passform ""normal"", Größe auch exakt wie gewollt. Toller Schuh, leicht, bequem und als Straßenschuh mit ""Fußballambition"" super geeignet."
"A mi hijo le han encantado!! Es lo que esperaba como se aprecia en la foto, volveré a comprar aquí las próximas! Rápido y sin problemas"
Sehr nicer Schuh :-)
J'ai acheté taille 36.5 pour un 36. Parfait pour mon fils qui voulait des chaussures de foot sans crampons afin de les mettre dans la vie quotidienne.
Super
Fit perfect daughter loves them
Unsere Tochter liebt ihre neuen gummistiefel. Durch das Herausnehmbare fleece hat sie selbst bei Temperaturen in einstelligen Bereich Warme Füße. Einzig der Geruch des Materials ist etwas stark und unangenehm.
Der gummistiefel hat die Erwartungen voll erfüllt. Meine Tochter hat ihn auch schon in allen Punkten ausreichend getestet und der Stiefel hat mit Bravour bestanden. Ich kann diesen nur weiterempfehlen.
Ich kaufe schon zweite mal diese Gummistiefel und bin zufrieden. Gute Qualität und  bequem tragen.
👍
"Top produkt, günstige Preise."
I like this
Très rapide et bonne qualité
Súper bonitos! A la medida
"We bought these for baseball season this year which was quarantined after he only got to play 1 inning.  Anyway, he wears a 13 in all other cleats but we had to return for a 14.  I was impressed that as soon as they received the info that they were shipping back by Fed Ex, they issued my refund & the others were on their way.  I have no complaints, worked great, comfy & look good.  A nice difference from all black cleats you find.  Most importantly to parents, they were cheap but not cheaply made.  I definitely recommend these."
I am returning for only 1 reason...my son have narrow feet and his heel slides up & down in these cleats.  Otherwise we would be keeping them.  Toe box and across the middle fits well.  I always have to go a 1/2 shorter to get shoes to fit the rest of his foot unless they’re narrow.  That didn’t work for the heel on these.
"Perfect fit! These cleats are amazing! My son absolutely loves them! We've been looking for metal cleats for him and most are upward of $80-$100! I took a chance and got these for him,.. and they were perfect in sizing! Amazon, you made one happy ball player!"
Awesome
"Comfy, sturdy"
Got these for my son and he loved them.
Exactly what i expected. great product
"really comfortable, for a month then ok"
"The heel on this shoe is very hard and there is no arch support. I need to buy insoles for these, which is really disappointing.The build quality is excellent. The fit is a little large. The looks are... ugly. Good grip. Not too hot. Easy to put on. Just sad about the soles."
"son muy cómodos, amplios y holgados, son un poco cansados porque la plantilla es plana, y con el tiempo se descosieron de las costuras a la altura del doblez que se hace al caminar, pero fuera de eso están muy bien, la punta de acero no es molesta y es muy útil."
"I'm a Carpenter I know boots, these are good ones i love Keen when I can get em at the right price and I did."
Not CSA approvedReturned for refund
"El zapato izquierdo me quedo bien pero el derecho estaba mucho más amplio que se me salía al intentar caminar, a pesar que eran de la misma talla."
i command 10.5 large wath i got it more like 9.5 not large but i give 2 star for the quality of the shoe
"Excelentes, comodas, buen ajuste y tal cual como dice el anuncio"
"Me encantan las uso diario en el trabajo son el segundo par igual que compro, un poco pesadas pero menos que una bota completa, comodas y se ven muy bien"
"Comfortable fit, not too heavy"
Excelentes! La mejor compra que he hecho son muy cómodos y tienen La opción de talla ancha. Siento que ando en tennis en el trabajo.
"Scarpe originali di tela nera ma i passanti in ferro a forma di cuore si sono staccati dopo appena tre giorni. Per quello che concerne la misura, calzano leggermente più piccolo"
Bellissime scarpe! Colori accesi e dettagli davvero belli
"Super bonitas,mi ahijada no se las keria kitar"
PER UN REGALO AD UNA NIPOTINA. IL PRODOTTO E' PERFETTAMENTE CONFORME A QUANTO RAPPRESENTATO ED E' PARTICOLARMENTE ECONOMICO. SONO ESTREMAMENTE SODDISFATTO
Molto belle ma troppo piccole
"ravissantes tennis blanches à oeillets colorés qui sont en forme de coeur !! bien taillées, mignonnes pour mettre avec des soquettes blanches et une  petite tenue décontractée ! un joli short et un joli tee shirt avec et c'est parfait! commandées en 25 pour ma puce qui chausse du 25, c'est super(ga) !! sérieux, arrivées dans les dates mêmes avant, tout va bien!"
Ottimo prodotto ad un prezzo ottimo
bellissime le ho prese alla mia nipotina... sono una favola... arrivate un giorno prima rispetto alla data...il colore e molto vivo
"I ordered my usual size and the length is perfect, true to size. However, the shoe is very roomy, so it would fit someone with medium to wide feet. I wore them for the first time today. Not much cushioning but comfortable enough to spend a few hours shopping."
"Muy contento con mi compra,sin duda los puma king son los mejores,se adaptan muy bien al pie,de gran calidad los materiales, un clásico que nunca falla.  Solo recomendaría pedir media talla más,viene un poco ajustada, soy 8,pedí 8.5 y me quedaron perfecto."
I can always rely on Puma being a perfect fit and of a quality that never disappoints. This is my 14 th pair of Kings.
Excelente producto
"I've owned Puma Kings before.  It is my preferred indoor shoe.  Not sure what Puma has done as they seem to be slightly smaller than the last pair I bought.  I recommend buying a half size larger than your normal size.  Luckily, since they are made out of Kangaroo leather, they will stretch slightly, which is why I recommend a half size larger.  They were significantly tight when I first tried them on."
"I usually wear 8.5 and because after reading reviews I was afraid the size would be too small so I ordered size 9. When I tried them on the first time they felt too tight (small) but after actually using them (one game), they fit nicely and actually seem a little too big. I believe 8.5 would have been the best size.So my advice is to just order your size. It will seem too tight at first but it should be just fine after you wear them for a couple of hours."
"I've worn a few pairs of these and I keep going back to them for good reason.  For me they are very comfortable, the grip is excellent on grass and turf. They hold up to playing very well, and perhaps key I find my touch is very good with this shoe. I've paid full 90 minutes in hot weather and my feet are fine.They may cost a little more than other brands at this quality point, but the investment in my opinion is worthwhile."
"These shoes have been great. I am 260 lbs, but still pretty agile for my size. I practice twice a week and games on the weekends, playing on short grass. No problems with glue separating or knobbies busting. Very happy... I usually wear a 12 but got a 12.5 based on previous reviews. It worked well for me."
extremely narrow therefore could only put them on if taking out insoles however length size was accurate so after ordering a size bigger still felt tight while too big ....I actually have narrow feet but even for me were tight also quality is nowhere near the famous Puma King  ....got the reg Puma King di FG as the SG were having the studs unscrew easily unless played on natural grass
Used for light pick up games on a turf field. Started falling apart on the second session. Starting with the tongue tearing and then both souls splitting away from the shoe. They also run a bit small.
"The shoes are comfortable and fit nicely. He tried a work out on turf and they performed well. However, on a slightly wetter surface these may not grip as well."
"I love these boots. They’re comfortable and nice looking. However, after having them for only three months and only wearing them in an office setting, the leather is already cracking where the toe bends. I don’t see why a high quality boot would be doing this but maybe I got a defective pair? It is already passed the amazon return window so I may be out of luck. I’m glad I didn’t pay full price st least."
"really like these boots, perfect for professional office in cold winter months.  feet dont get wet, and the look stylish for the day to day.... Cole haan is my brand now.... good stuff"
This boot is legit. Real light which is to be expected by Nike people (Cole Haan). Love it.
Nice and comfortable.
These things are very nice. Will buy more.
Very nice looking and comfortable
Great style and comfort for a boot!
Estuvieron perfectas
"Qualität ist super. Da unsere Tochter sehr schmale Füße hat fällt es oft schwer den passenden Schuh zu finden. Dieser hier passt perfekt und sie läuft auch in einer Nummer größer perfekt darin, so das er hoffentlich auch für den Herbst noch passt. Der Schuh hält auch einiges aus, unsere Tochter geht nicht sehr pfleglich mit ihren Schuhen um (tobt sehr viel in der Schule, ohne Rücksicht auf Sachen und Schuh,  so das so einige günstige Variante anderer Marken schon nach sehr kurzer Zeit kaputt gegangen sind), aber dieser Schuh hält so einigem stand!Die Blinklichter an der Seite sind für sie natürlich das größte Highlight...."
Klasse Schuh. Super Passform. Durch Klett für die kleinen selbst an- und ausziehbar. Tolle LED Blinklichter
"Wir lieben Richter-Schuhe, passen super, sehen schick aus und durch die herausnehmbare Sohle lässt sich gut feststellen, ob sie passen!"
"Ich habe die Schuhe für den Waldkindergarten im Sommer ausgesucht. Mir war wichtig, dass sie wasserdicht sind und gut am Fuß sitzen. Das ist beides gegeben. Wie von Kamik gewohnt, fallen die Schuhe kleiner aus. Sie sind relativ eng am Einstieg und passen meinem Sohn mit seinen schmalen Füßen gut. Er kann sie alleine anziehen und auch enger stellen.Gekauft habe ich sie Anfang April, durch Corona (Kiga geschlossen) hat er sie allerdings nicht oft getragen. Jetzt Anfang Juni haben die Schuhe an den Seiten Löcher im Obermaterial und sind leider auch nicht mehr dicht. Bei einer Preisempfehlung des Herstellers von 85€ ein Unding.  Ich habe die Schuhe reklamiert und muss mich auf die Suche nach neuen Schuhen machen, schade."
"Super Wander- und Freizeitschuhe in sehr guter Qualität.Ich habe den Schuh in Größe 26 bestellt wo er noch mit Klettverschluss und elastischen Schnürsenkeln kommt. Das ist super für kleinere Kinderfüsse, so lässt sich der Schuh weit öffnen und leicht an- und ausziehen. (Erst ab Größe 28 kommt der Schuh ohne Klett-band und mit einem Schnellverschluss System).Die Innensohle ist herausnehmbar und hat zudem einen gekennzeichneten Bereich wie weit die Zehen des Kinderfusses gehen sollten.Die Schuhe sind sehr leicht und angenehm zu tragen. Er eignet sich für leichte Wanderungen aber auch so als Outdoor- und Feitzeitschuh, gerade für Matsch- und Schneewetter, da er über den Knöchel geht und die Kinderfüße so gut geschützt sind.Mir war außerdem wichtig, dass die Schuhe eine Gore Tex Membrane haben und somit wasserdicht sind!Ich habe das gleiche Modell auch noch als ""low cut"" Variante bestellt, diese ist noch etwas leichter und Alltagstauglicher!Fazit: Toller Schuh, den man aber gerade für längere Wanderungen eher eine Nummer Größer bestellen sollte!"
"Super Schuh. Er ist leicht, wasserdicht, robust und trotzdem flexibel in der Sohle. Er ist etwas höher geschnitten, sodass nicht gleich alles in den Schuh läuft und der Knöchel gut gestützt ist. Mein Sohn und ich finden ihn Klasse. Und cool aussehen tut er auch;-)"
Ich habe diese Schuhe für meine Tochter gekauft und sie findet sie toll. Sie trägt sie jeden Tag und schwitzt nicht darin.
Habe den Schuh für meinen 9-jährigen Sohn gekauft. Die Größe passt wie erwartet. Der Schuh ist sehr gut verarbeitet und mit GoreTex macht man sowieso nichts falsch. Der Schuh ist sehr robust und er wird bei uns nicht geschont. Ich würde ihn auf jeden Fall wieder kaufen und meinem Sohn gefällt er auch.
"Der Schuh sieht gut aus und scheint bequem zu sein. Ich finde den Schuh entgegen anderer Bewertungen eher breit geschnitten und auch nach ""oben"" hin ist viel Platz, für die Füße meines Kindes mit niedrigem Spann fast ein bisschen zu viel."
"Der Schuh sieht super aus und ich hätte mich sehr gefreut, wenn er meinem Sohn gepasst hätte. Leider ist der Schuh aber nichts für breite Füße mit hohem Rist."
Toll endlich wanderschuhe in dieser grösse... passt perfekt
"Gran zapatilla, alta, da mayor sensación de agarre al pie. En este caso ideales para basket o cualquier superficie indoor."
Justo como se ve en la foto . Buen calidad . Me gustaron mucho . Los recomiendo
Love these shoes are great for my little boys and kids any other type of shoe extremely dirty white part is easy to clean in the black part  stays looking great
"My kids all wear Under Armour Asserts, as well as my husband and myself. The tread is substantial and grips asphalt well and does pretty good on easy family hikes as well. The toe box width seems larger than other brands, which works well for our wide feet. I find these to run half size big. My son's both wear a half size smaller in adidas shoes."
"My son wears these to school every day. He hates wearing  shoes in general, but he doesn’t seem to have a problem wearing these all day. They are wide enough for chubby feet, but ran quite larger than expected. I had to order a half size smaller than his typical size, and they are perfect."
"Sooooo i have bought three pairs of these shoes, and they are worth every penny!!! The soles do not wear or rip off like Sketchers. They are also great for my kiddos feet development."
"These are my favorite shoes I’ve ever gotten for my son.  He says they are very comfortable and I think the color combo is too cute. True to size, and great quality. My son has had them for months now and they are still clean and not falling apart. Winning!"
"Really nice quality shoe. Just runs narrow. It's a little long for my son, but a smaller size and he wouldn't get it on his foot. He doesn't have wides feet either. Overall he likes it though."
"After 1 week of wearing, the strip on sole continues to come off. Literally super glued back 3 times and it’s off again. Shoes look good as expected but won’t buy again"
2 nd pair bought for some ! He runs every 1 mile in them and then school. Sturdy shoe he loves them . Super comfy.
But they for the 5 year old and he likes them for school old worn then a couple weeks will have to wait and see how they last. He did not destroy shoes. He can put them on and take them off easily and says in the heat they are keeping his feet cold (not sweetly).
"Consiglio queste scarpe, belle, comode e misura perfetta. Il prezzo molto inferiore rispetto a tanti altri venditori, il più basso in assoluto. Spedizione velocissima come sempre da Amazon."
Calza una taglia in meno. Io porto il 40 ho dovuto prendere il 41. Per il resto scarpa bellissima e comoda
"Por mucho tiempo busque un modelo parecido a este, no estaba muy convencido, pero al final por el precio me decidí a comprarlos, por 600 fue una ganga, cuando llegaron venían en su caja original, venían muy bien envueltos y cuidados, y como es de esperar, la calidad de Reebok es genial, vienen acolchados por dentro con una tela azul muy padre, quedaron a la medida justa, son muy cómodos para la oficina sin ser tan informal, Volveria comprar otros solo en caso de que los que tengo se acaben ( y para eso pueden pasar varios años) Excelente calidad, muy recomendables! =)"
"Super Schuh und gut verarbeitet, äußerlich.  Die inneren Werte lassen zu wünschen übrig. Nach einem Tag im Büro, also den Schuh nicht wirklich belaufen, löste sich die innere Sohle und wollte sich. Also sehr nervig zu laufen wenn die Sohle Wellen und Falten hat.Am zweiten Tag habe ich sie dann komplett entfernt und eine andere Einlegesohle verwendet. Nun ists perfekt.Habe ihn behalten. Wäre es kein Internationaler Versand und son Stress mit Zollpapiere usw hätte ich ihn auf jeden Fall retourniert.Aufgrund dessen 3 Sterne."
"Los tenis son MUY cómodos, al principio la plantilla que traen se siente rara e incomoda, pero conforme va tomando forma, se vuelve una de sus mayores ventajas. Son livianos y en superficies resbalosas muestran buen agarre, por lo que definitivamente los recomendaría."
These are pathetic I purchased these for my dad for Father’s Day and he said they came apart on the whole side of one runner he has always worn Reebok’s so what is up with these from here I don’t know I’m not happy about this at all.
Great shoe! Look great and feel great. Go true to size on these. Shipping took 2 business days. Great for the summer as they are very light and comfy. Been looking for nice white shoes to go with some light wash denims and these are amazing. Also they have memory-tech insoles (memory foam insoles) which make these incredibly comfortable. I might need to buy a pair to wear indoors to replace my slippers!
"Excelente opción, los clásicos remasterizados​, la plantilla memorytech es buena aunque no la mejor, materiales 100% de alta calidadLos recomiendo Reebok nunca defrauda"
Great experience. Item arrived on time and in perfect condition. Also these are some of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn.. The memory foam in the soles is really great!
"Muy comodos y suaves, el pedido llego en tiempo , muy contento de recordar este modelo en particular, lo recomiendo ampliamente."
"Un producto de calidad en relación a precio además muy cómodo por su plantilla azul, con un estilo muy clásico."
bien para el precio
"Wir kaufen ausschließlich WMS-zertifizierte Schuhe für unsere Kinder, einfach weil uns wichtig ist, dass die Größe auch wirklich zum Kinderfuß passt.Superfit ist unsere Lieblingsmarke: schönes DesignRobustSuper VerarbeitungUnsere Tochter trägt die Sandalen täglich- im Garten, im Sandkasten, beim Laufrad fahren …..und Form und Farbe halten.Schmutz lasse ich trocknen und bürste ihn dann einfach aus.Wir hatten im vergangenen Jahr bereits dieses Modell, nur in einer anderen Farbe. Lässt sich von Kindern auch leicht alleine an und ausziehen.Gerade wenn man viel im Gelände unterwegs ist, sind die Sandalen einfach top, weil sie dem Fuß Halt geben und die Zehe geschützt sind( war mir sehr wichtig).Die Sandalen sind recht preisintensiv, halten aber die komplette Saison bei täglicher Nutzung & könnten dann sogar noch an jüngere Geschwister vererbt werden- wenn man das bei Schuhen denn macht.Also klare Kaufempfehlung!"
"Sandalen für unsere Tochter bestellt. Passen perfekt, genug Freiraum vorne. Gute Passform bei eher schmalen Füßen. Und die Farbe und Applikationen gefallen ihr sehr gut. Genau nach ihrem Geschmack."
Cute comfy. Many compliments. Like the colors. I have others in different colors
Great design with a darker toe to hide the dirt of my 8 year old. He loved the bright colors on the heel and underside. Well made. Guy was perfect!  Under armour never disappoints!
Perfect. Son loved them.
Geniales para pasear o incluso salir de fiesta.  Parecen zapatos con el adorno dorado de la suela.
Super schöne und sehr gut verarbeitete Schuhe.Tragen sich gut und sind sehr bequem.Einfach Tipi Topi.
"Eccellenti scarpe, molto comode peccato siano fuori produzione"
"confortevoli, alla moda"
"Ich bin begeistert, danke . Super 5 Sterne."

Great
"For the most part, I really like these shoes.  I like how they look, and for the most part they're comfortable.  The only problem for me is that I have wide feet, and these run a bit narrow.  They're comfortable when I first put them on, but they become painful for me to wear after a while, as the narrowness applies constant pressure to the outsides of the balls of my feet and squishes my pinky toes inward when I walk.  If you do not have wide feet, I'm sure these shoes are great.  If you do, you may want to pick a different shoe."
"The shoes look great. I only wear them in an office environment, so I can't really comment on durability. The overall size fits just as I expected.My only complaint is sole comfort, but, in the shoes' defense, that's a recurring issue for us flat-footed folks...So, for you flat-footers out there, they look great! Wear them to a casual office job or out to dinner, but don't wear them to Disneyland."
I have flippers so it's not Adidas' fault. I still rock them though because they're dope.. even after running through mud with them - washed up like new.
"Good looking shoe, my normal 10 was probably a half or whole size too small. Common problem for me buying shoes. With this shoe order a half or whole size up for a better fit"
My son will only wear these shoes.  He works in a professional job where he sometimes has to do a lot of physical work.  These shoes are comfortable while looking nice for a job!!
Love them. Very comfortable and great looking.
My toes were being squished and my heel was lifting out of the shoe with every step. Too much friction from the rubbing. Just won't work for me. Returning!
"Fit great, look great, extremely comfortable"
I had an older pair of these that were not long for this world and was looking everywhere for a replacement. Glad I found these! Great everyday shoes
"Good quality and durability, my little angel likes it too much, highly recommend it. Very fast delivery.Can be used as sandals also."
"Die Applikationen aber auch das „Band“ fällt sehr schnell aus der Verankerung. Daher nicht so wie gewünscht. Sicher kann man auch ohne beides auskommen, ist halt dann nicht mehr so schön."
Die Schuhchen sind so schön und niedlich nur leider hätten wir lieber ein Nummer größer genommen. Es sieht sehr solide aus und auf jeden Fall empfehlen wir den zu kaufen. Nächstes Mal bestellen wir bisschen größer.
"Vielen Dank für die schnelle Liefeerung! Die Kinder Clogs gefallen uns sehr gut, sind sehr niedlich.DANKE!"
Fallen sehr groß aus. Sonst schön
Clogs sehen super aus und passen perfekt
Gute Qualität
Sehr schön
"molto carini, peccato che ho preso una misura in più e gli calzano un poco grandi."
Taillé trop grand
Súper bien todo pero viene SIN CALAS! DEBEIS COMPRAR A PARTE!
"Los tenis me gustaron, resultaron ser bastante cómodos y a un precio que en México sera difícil encontrar al menos en tiendas departamentales. Fue compra de importación y me salieron en 658 pesos, al menos revisando sitios en México están arriba de los 2000 pesos. Esta clase de tenis de PUMA se presta a que uno le ponga su propio diseño con múltiples hoyos para meter agujetas de cualquier tamaño y color. El material es bueno y las suela es lo bastante cumplidora ya sea para actividades físicas o bien solo para uso casual. Tiene un excelente soporte y ajuste para el tobillo.En cuanto al envío fue de importación por medio de MEXBUY y entregado por Amazon MX lOGISTICS. Entregado con anticipación y en excelente estado."
"El producto es muy bonito, cómodo y la verdad se ven muy elegantes. Con La facilitadas de acomodar tú cómo quieres los cordones me parece fascinante por qué ya depende de la forma que los quieras tú. Recomiendo estos tenis."
"Muy lindos y comodos pero quedan poco grandes, recomiendo pedir media talla menos oara que les ajuste bien ya que es de tela calcetin"
Muy bonitos y aun buen precio..Me gustaron mucho.
El tenis es cómodo y se ve bien el problema en mi caso es que mi empeine del pie es alto y me lastimaba en ese sitio
Fueron mis primeros pares de PUMA ya que anteriormente usaba NIKE. Quedé muy satisfecho por la comodidad y el material de los tennis. Además de que cuentan con un diseño bastante moderno.
"Bastante cómodos, la tela estira, no es rígida, se ven geniales aunque no le veo uso a las agujetas así que se las quité y se ven mucho mejor. 100% recomendados, los adiquirí a buen precio así que son una gran compra."
"El articulo que pedí nunca llegó y mi dinero ni idea donde esta, le escribo al venderdor y no responde."
"Compré los negros, se ven muy bien, la suela es comodisima y la plantilla es de las mejores, aunque si tienes los pies anchos la verdad es que ajustan bastante, aún así los recomiendo mucho."
Excelente tenis
"These appear to essentially be the replacement for the Cael v8.0s, maybe with some minor improvements. I originally ordered the Cael v8.0s in a 10.5US and had to return them because they were too narrow. I ordered these in an 11US (a full size larger than normal for me) and they fit comfortably snug. I got them for martial arts and they will also be good for weight training. They grip great, but still allow twisting without catching on the mat. I like the mid-high top design as they keep my heel in place and add a bit of extra ankle support. The tongue is not too bulky either. Doesn't hurt that they also look totally cool."
"First of all I bought these shoes to wear while lifting weights, so I have no idea how well they perform on the mat, but they look and feel great. They put your feet flat on the floor as if you were barefoot while giving ankle support; similar feel to Converse, except they contour to your feet and are more lightweight. However the soles will put you at a slight deficit, so keep that in mind if you plan on deadlifting.Personally I wear a 10.5 in most shoes, including Vans, Reebok and Nike. Occasionally I have to size down, like with Doc Martens (size 9-10) and Converse (9.5). I was skeptical of purchasing these online after reading negative reviews about the fit, so I went half a size up to be safe. After trying them on, I think they're overblown. I'm happy with the 11s, but I honestly think I could've broke in my usual size, since they're pretty malleable. Unless you have wider feet I wouldn't worry about the fit."
"This is my first pair of boxing shoes so I was very worried about the fit according to the many reviews I read about on the sizing. Most of them recommended getting a full size up, but I went with my gut feeling and just got a half size up. I usually wear a size 9 1/2 for most regular shoes, so I went with a size 10 for this boxing shoe. Fit was perfect. Of course, boxing shoes will always have that snug/tight feel, but the pair I got had just the right amount of tightness. Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase! I will buy this again in the future when the one I have wears out."
To small please order one size bigger. Good quality shoe. See pictures comparation. They are both size US 11.
"The shoes were somewhat narrow at first but then stretched out and were good, but i now see the oitside of the shoe separating from the sole and a hoke js developing. I have only iwned the shoes for 7 or 8 months. I will see if they are an honorable company and will replace these wrestling shoes with a new pair."
Shoes were far too narrow
"My husband was hoping these would be good for his work. He tried them for a cpl wks @ home, but it didn't help. He normally wears an 11, reg width. Normally, if the shoe is a tad bit skinny, going up to a 12 gives that wee bit of extra width.... Nope..."
"Read the review so I decided to size up- glad I did beacuse they are a bit tight and smaller. Otherwise, a great shoe- my boyfriend loves to wear it during leg training days in the gym because of its flat sole."
"Fantastic shoe although it seemed to run just slightly larger than expected. All four of my sons have been using ASICS the last 5 years and most models seem to fit true to size. While this model seems to fit a little larger, the price was awesome, my son liked the new color options, and it seems durable."
"I have a pair of ASICS Gel Kayano 5 in US 9.5 / Euro 43.5 and they have plenty of room, so I initially ordered a size US 10 as many have recommended sizing up for ASICS wrestling boots.  I had to return them because they were so tight.  Re-ordered, this time in a US 10.5 and looking at the tongue it is Euro 43.5.  These do fit well."
They are made really well and are very pretty.  I received the shoes on time and I tried them on but they were a bit small.  I think I have to break them in and then they might fit a little better.  They do come with an insole so if they are a little big I think that would help them fit better. I have small feet. size 4 1/2.  I would have given them a 5 star rating but they did fit snug.  I would have returned them but had already worn them out of the house.  If you are looking to purchase go a half size up.
"Looked at reviews and did buy them bigger than my size 7 street shoe size, I got size 8. Plenty of room without being too loose or looking big like clown shoes, and fits well in the heel. The strap has a good bit left since I have to use the closest hole but I found I can also fasten the buckle and leave it buckled and slide them on, which will be helpful if I have a quick change. The extra bit of strap isn’t bothering me at this point.I’ll definitely need an insert of some kind for the balls of my feet though, after a three hour rehearsal, my feet hurt. I love the height and overall look of these shoes, definitely give the extra glamor I was after. Just need them to feel better and they’ll be almost perfect."
"I'm a professional dancer and we recently began rehearsals again. I brought my new character shoes to use at rehearsal but when I put them on, it was extremely disappointing. I had gotten a size 5.5 regular width before and they were far too big. I ordered a size 5 narrow width thinking it would solve my problems. Nope! They were hilariously small. For reference, I own a pair of Sperry boat shoes in child size 2.5. I couldn't even get my foot into them and neither could a fellow dancer with even smaller feet than mine. Unfortunately with all of the Covid stuff, I didn't get to try them on until well after the return window had ended so the money I spent is lost."
They run a little small. I ordered in my street size and the just fit. I like I tight fitting dance shoe so that works for me. They did have little scuffs on the toes when they came but they are in prefect condition otherwise.
I open a broken box to USED SHOES. These shoes are clearly USED. Really??? They are sent back.
"I like the way it feels, but the size is a little bigger than the actual size."
Order one complete size larger!
"It's good, fits nice, seems to be lasting well enough, but you'll likely have to poke another hole for the straps."
"Wore them for a 20's themed New Year's Eve Party and the looked perfect for the period.  Having used Bloch shoesfor dance in the past, I knew they would be great."
Fit is nice. Very comfortable.
"Busqué este modelo en muchas tiendas en línea, y afortunadamente pude encontrarlo en Amazon, quería unos tenis blancos hasta que este modelo me convenció definitivamente, y ahora que los recibo son Super Bonitos, Muy Cómodos, la talla va de acuerdo a la establecida, soy 24.5 y pedí exactamente en ese número y me quedó Perfecto! El Envío fué muy rápido, en Perfectas Condiciones."
"Demasiado angostos, lo peor que el fabricante no lo especifica y la foto es engañosa, es la primera vez que me pasa que un zapato que pido de Amazon EEUU  no me queda, y eso que siempre los pido un número más grande porque tengo empeine alto, decepcionada. Ya no los regresé por lo engorroso del trámite."
Excelentes y muy bonitos. Son de piel blanca con suela de goma naranja. Son muy cómodos y de buena calidad.Las tallas vienen correctas y son originales.Es un modelo clásico de la marca que está a un excelente precio en Amazon.
These are so nice and comfortable. Highly recommend. But be sure to order 1 size up. Love them! :)
"Son muy bonitos los tenis pero definitivamente quedan grandes, recomendaría pedir medio número menor"
"Súper hermosos, me encantaron tardan en llegar pero la espera lo vale"
"Son cómodos, de piel y se ven muy bien."
"Super bonitos, me encantaron, super precio y llegaron antes de la fecha estimada, muy contenta con esta compra!"
"Siempre los quise y ahora ya es posible tenerlos, después de dos cambios de talla por fin encontré la mía, son muy bonitos y atractivos a la vista, únicos"
"Los pedí en 25½ y me quedan un poco grandes, pero son cómodos y se ven muy bien."
I was really confused on the listing of these shoes that indicated they were for little kids (ages 4-8) but yet had sizes for big kids. I took a chance and I’m glad I did. We ordered a size 5 for our 11 year old and they fit our son perfectly! He absolutely loves these shoes for hiking! The product description is misleading but I’m so thankful we tried it!
"I was beginning to think kids sneakers were just doomed to fall apart every 2 months. My son is so hard on shoes, and we've bought all the name brands, under armour, Nike, new balance, Saucony, and other styles of Adidas. The soles were falling apart after 2 months every time. These Adidas terrex shoes are sturdy as can be! At first my son found them too stiff, but after 3 or 4 days they felt comfortable. They look as good as the day I bought them and are showing no signs of wearing down any time soon. I love that they're water resistant too, so they're good winter sneakers. True to size."
"Nice, a little bit sturdy, but no complains from my 10 year old kid during 1st hiking trip with them, good grip. I liked them."
Grandson loves them
"son muy cómodos, únicamente añadiría que son un poquito estrechos, yo tengo el pie un poco ancho y me apretaban un poco pero he aflojado mucho los cordones que son elásticos y la verdad se me adaptan bien"
"Son buenas zapatillas, he mirado mucha paginas para compartir el precio, amazon es el más barato"
"Il prodotto va bene, però della marca Geox mi aspettavo di più qualità, l'ecco pelle e di pessima qualità, peccato il resto tutto va bene."
Buon acquisto
"Bellissima, il colore uguale alla foto, misura giusta ."
"warte jetzt nur noch auf die gutschrift,da die schuhe leider zu gross waren"
Muy cómodo .estoy muy contenta.  Lo único malo es que con lluvia patinan . Esa es la pega que le veo pero por lo demás estupendas
Perfectas de talla y muy comodas
"Scarpe molto comode per muoversi, suola adatta al sostegno."
Excellente. Largeur confort
"Me encantó el modelo,  se ve muy diferente a lo convencional.  Es cómoda pero al menos yo no lo usaría para correr.  En su comodidad la siento firme,  y se tiene que acostumbrar el pie a, si horma ya que al menos yo la sentí diferente... Un poco rara pero eso no significa que sea incomoda.. al contrario.  Como en una hora mis pies se acostumbrar on a la horma.  Hay que tomar en cuenta que las lengüeta no existe en este modelo.  Es una suma pieza al estilo UltraBoost de Adidas. Igual el ajuste con los cordones es con la parte de platico externa que cubre al zapato.. como los Adidas."
cannot say enough about how muuch i love these runners .... i have multiple back and knee injuries as well as painful planter facaititus ... this shoe manages to practically eliminate my painful feet and has helped me walk with real ease. love love these shoes
"I’ve been running in Wave Creations for easily 10 years or more, and this new version is *not* what I’m used to. The tongue is attached to the shoe, making it hard to put on, the fit is different (tighter than previous versions), but the most disappointing part is the workmanship. With less than 10km on these shoes, they have started disintegrating all through the heel area (see photos). They started squeaking while I was on a run, and upon inspection after running, I found that foam padding was breaking down and coming apart. These are being returned, and I’ll either wait for the next version, or perhaps check out another company. Sorry Mizuno, these just aren’t up to standard :("
"I had a pair of Mizunos for 4 years. Great shoe! When it was time for a new pair I bought the newer model. I’ve been wearing them for less than 4 months and only in my home gym. I went to lace them up as usual, pulled the laces tighter and the lace ripped right through the hole! These are expensive shoes and I would expect better quality. Amazon won’t offer me a credit, a refund or a replacement. Not impressed."
"Folks, I would not recommend buying this shoes! I've just picked up the shoes and compared with the original and this product is completely terrible. The glue is really visible, the fabrics' cuts are not aligned. The  front leather fabric has inferior quality compared to the original. Also, the glue was kind of accidentally manufactured poured onto the fabric. I will be return this product today."
A little tight for my boyfriend but he enjoys them :)He says they feel bouncy when you walk haha.
"Excellent shoes so far. I run in them. I’ve been running in them for a few weeks. I have no pain in my knees when I run, so I’m happy about that.  I will update the review if anything changes."
really like the shoes but have already scuffed the toe after wearing them for a few hours. but fit really nice
Less than 20km into these shoes part of the sole on the heel just fell off. For over 200$ shoes that is outrageous. That hasn’t happened to shoes that had 1000km on them. I have been loyal to mizuno for a decade so this is extremely disappointing.
Love! Beautiful!
Schuhe sind super bequem. Wie immer ist ein Schuh von Caprice perfekt für meine Füße.
"Schicker Schuh,weiches Material. Trägt sich gut."
Paar Lederfalten zu viel. Ansonsten super
ok for this price ...but no other pair like this one
"Die Weite ist super, auch bei geschwollenen Füßen angenehm zu tragen."
Super bequeme Schuhe!
CONFORME A LA COMMANDE
Bellissime e comode ad un prezzo veramente basso.Pagate 42 euro.Sono da bambina ma preso il mio numero 38 e vanno benissimo.Grazie Amazon come sempre veloce nelle consegne.
"Buenos, bonitos y NO muy caros...."
"Der Schuh ist optisch sehr schön und absolut unempfindlich. Auch bequem ist er sehr und gehört damit zu den Lieblingsschuhen meiner Tochter. Allerdings mussten wir die Schnürsenkel entfernen, da meine Tochter- obwohl sehr schmale, dünne Füße - immer wieder große Schwierigkeiten hatte, in den Schuh zu kommen. Es ist aber durchaus vorgesehen, dass man die Schuhe auch ohne Senkel nutzen kann, die Zunge ist nämlich mit Gummibändern fixiert, damit der Schuh auch so gut am Fuß hält (ein Schild am Schuh wies darauf hin, dass man diesen auch so tragen kann). Nachteil ist allerdings, dass die Schuhe ohne Senkel nur halb so schön aussehen. Wir haben die Schuhe stark reduziert erhalten und sind somit insgesamt zufrieden."
Es un regalo
Son tan bonitas como la foto. La purpurina tiene unos brillos muy chulos en en plata y azulados segun le incida la luz. Los compre para un regalo a una niña de 7 años y le encantaron. Ademas la marca geox siempre es sinónimo de garantia para mi gusto.
Ma fille est ravie
Personalmente non sono una grande fan di scarpe Geox..ogni volta si presenta lo stesso problema :ovvero se piove assorbono acqua ! Anche queste..però bisogna dire che sono davvero bellissime!Se evitate giorni di pioggia le consiglio :)
"Non é mai successo di ricomprare per due volte lo stesso paio di scarpe. Comodissime, belle esteticamente,prezzo onesto per una Geox."
"La scarpa è di vera pelle e la vestibilità è corretta. A mia figlia sono piaciute molto. Se devo trovare un aspetto negativo,  per cui do 4 e non 5 stelle, è che la pelle è un po' dura e c'è bisogno del calzascarpe per indossarla."
"Wir haben den Schuh in weiß gekauft und leider hat sich bereits am zweiten Tag die weiße Farbe vorn auf der Fußspitze gelöst. Haben zu spät gesehen, dass es kein echtes Leder ist. Sehr schade, endlich mal ein weißer Sneaker, der wasserdicht ist und keine Schnörekleien dran hat (da unpraktisch für Kindergarten)."
"Son las primeras con cordones para mi sobrina, le encantan. No se las quita. Dice que son muy cómodas."
"En principio contenta, bonitos, mi hija dice que cómodos pero al mes de uso cogieron un olor horrible. Es la primera vez que me pasa con esta marca."
"Es gab fast Tränen in unserem Haushalt, dass wir diesen schönen, bequemen, gut sitzenden Schuh nicht behalten haben - aber es ging einfach nicht: Bei der kleinsten Bewegung quietschte es deutlich. Für uns war das leider nicht zu ertragen."
"Son muy bonitas pero llevan dentro unas gomas que hace imposible que el pie pueda entrar aunque la zapatilla sea un número más. Se las tuve que cortar, no sé qué función tienen"
"Sono già le quarte Mizuno che compro e devo dire che le ricomprerò.Peccato non ci sia il 41,5"
Molto belle e soprattutto molto comode. Solitamente utilizzo scarpe alte che coprano la caviglia; queste mizuno invece sono più basse ma offrono comunque un'ottima stabilità nei movimenti.
Ottimo prodotto consigliato
Sehr bequeme Schuhe
Bellissime
Everything as described.
Artikelbeschreibung ist hier leider falsch. Der hellblau beworbene Chuck ist in Wahrheit türkis. Vorsicht also bei der Bestellung. Rücksendung wurde beantragt.Add: ich warte seit Tagen auf die Bearbeitung der Rücksendung und Gutschrift (Planet Sports)! So soll Amazon nicht sein!
These are not real Johnston and Murphys. I kept wondering why they fit larger. I chalked it up to user error and bought some inserts so I can actually wear them. As I put the insoles I'm I noticed that they were the exact size as MY OTHER 3 JOHNSTON AND MURPHYS. So I started digging. Made in a different country as the other 3. Leather was noticeably different then the other 3. Every code was different on the tongue of the shoe. Sole was noticeable different.
"Way to stiff, my first day I literally wore a hole in my heel. I can’t bring myself to put them on again. I have bought JM in the past and loved them but those where in the 150 dollar range. It appears you get what you pay for."
I have no complaints. They look nice and they feel good even after a long day.
"I really like this shoes, but it made too big/long for a normal size. I use this product for my daily work."
Amazing
I love the style of the shoe but it very stiff in the sole. This makes it uncomfortable to wear even after trying to break it in.
"Very nice shoes, great deal. Good for the office"
Exactly what he wanted
foot pain
love the price and built quality
"I have wide feet, in summer they tend to swell a bit due to the heat. These shoes still fit without constricting blood flow due to the stretch fabric upper. They look smart and work really well at giving me comfort when I’m on my feet all day. They’re worth every penny."
My third pair ... love them
Satisfied with product.  Product received in a timely fashion and as described.
Awesome shoes. This is my second pair...
Super confortable et jolie
"I love BZees sneakers and already have two pairs.  They are well made, extremely comfortable and, most important, machine washable!  Now I finally have a pair in black!"
Souliers que je porte tout le temps
I loved that the product was exactly as described and so comfortable!
Bien todo
Very confortable!  I would recommend without hesitation.
"die Schuhe sind schön warm, aber leider etwas klobig. Aber zum spazierengehen mit dem Hund ok."
Muy cómodas y calientitas
"Cute but the cut of these did not work for me, returned.  The insole was cushiony but the shape of the boot made it uncomfortable to walk in.  Also, the top of the boot has a large opening which is good for accommodating different sizes but it slides around unless you cinch it all the way with the laces which I think will crease the material over time and also just felt kind of weird.  I would like to see this concept redesigned since it is a cute style but just fits really strangely (sizing up or down wouldn't have helped) and did not feel very practical."
I was so DISAPPOINTED that these walking shoes would NOT allow me to slide my foot inside ! I'm 66 yrs old and walk my 82 lb dog twice a day.  These shoes looked like the perfect footwear for light snowfall days.  HAH. The opening at the top is too narrow and rigid.  There are no gussets that allow the opening to widen and accomodate your heel and ankle.  Very POOR design !  Because of that I cannot comment on the fit or comfort.  I had high hopes for these.  The tread on the bottom of the shoe and the ankle support would have made this a very stable shoe/boot.
"I really like these boots but I just wish they were a little bit more comfortable. I had to return my regular size and get a half size bigger because they definitely run small. I did keep the 7 1/2 because they are easy to wear and get around in in the city, but I find that my heel to slip out just a little bit even with my orthotics inside. I don’t think I would wear them every day but the days that I do with them they are pretty comfortable"
Looked nice-had to return too small
Could not get my foot all the way in the shoe. No side zipper or opening at the shoe laces to open up the shoe
I was unable to put my foot in the shoe. Returned immediately!!
Warm. Look good. However the soles make my ankles legs and knees bend in. I won’t be wearing them because of knee arthritis. Love new balance sneakers and was hoping these would be equally good.
Nice boots.
Sin preciosas y de muy buena calidad a buen precio
"I chose these shoes because of how amazingly they fit my feet when I tried them in an offline store. Unfortunately they had no proper size, so I ended up ordering shoes online.The order came in time and in a good shape, but on my second visit to bouldering gym I noticed that one of the laces started to tear. I didn't pay enough attention to that and that was my big mistake. You can see on the pictures how the lace look like after just 5 bouldering sessions. It's almost totally ruined on the left shoe and started to tear on the right one.This is especially surprising as I do not tie shoes tightly (they're 3 sizes smaller).Obviously it's too late to return them now after 1.5 months and visible signs of usage (is it even possible to have no such signs on climbing shoes?)Later I found out that this issue is so common for La Sportiva Solutions that some shoe repairs even have a separate price for replacing laces on this particular model. Unfortunately there are no specialized shoe repairs nearby and sending shoes to anywhere else is too expensive, so now I end up with brand new shoes without laces.Summarizing: do not buy this model if you're not ready to replace  laces right after the purchase."
I love this climbing shoes. Fit perfect. Seller 5 stars
Einfach klasse.An der Verse etwas unbequem aber sehr gute Schuhe!
"Ho acquistato queste scarpe fidandomi del marchio famoso, però devo dire che sono rimasta un pò delusa dalla qualità dei materiali, esteticamente sono anche belle , bel disegno, bella linea, però una cosa che proprio non  mi è piaciuta  è la qualità della plastica, cioè le scarpe sembrano proprio di plasticaccia cinese. La suola continua a farmi prendere la scossa e non capisco il motivo, ad ogni modo ho un pò paura che a lungo andare possano dare problemi di brutti odori ai piedi quindi sono ancora indecisa se renderle o meno. Tornassi indietro non penso le ricomprerei per rapporto qualità prezzo. E' vero che non sono costate chissà quanto, però dalla puma mi aspetto di più. Al momento non le consiglio."
"Great Quality, Nice cleats"
"Chulísimas,tal cual en foto,pedí un 37 y acierta en la talla."
"I play in at competive baseball league, defenetly the most comfortable cleats. I will recommend to get half of size bigger! Perfect cushion!!!"
Me encantan muy xulas talla correcta de normal en zapatilla uso 38 yperfectas
"Too heavy, heal support dug into back of foot."
Scarpe belle e comode arrivate con un giorno di anticipo serietà nella consegna veramente entusiasta su tutto
Only negative is how difficult it is to put them on.  Most comfortable cleats per my son once on.
"I love these new Mizuno Volleyball shoes. They are so comfortable and very light. They are mot heavy at all. I love them, i recomened anybody to buy these."
Great quality....
good shoe
Muy bueno.
Todo bien y se adelantó el envío
Perfecto me esta muy bien
Beautiful and fits perfectly... thank you!!!👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
"They’re a little narrow and made of cheap materials (mostly nylon), but they’re comfortable like slippers and everyone compliments them.  As for fit, they are narrower than expected and a little longer than expected, but it’s fine."
"Mit diesen Schuhen, ist unser Sohn für jede Situation gewappnet!Ob in der Freizeit, Kindergarten, oder auch auf einer Hochzeit, diese Schuhe kann man zu jedem Outfit kombinieren!Super Qualität und perfekte Passform!Kann ich nur weiterempfehlen!"
"Soy muy comodos los acabados de buena calidad y el diseño es muy bueno .Los uso para ir al Gym , puedes correr con ellos pero son pisada neutra por lo que no tiene mucha estabilidad , son excelentes para caminar , para ir al Gym , son muy frecos no pesan ,no lastiman ninguna costura , son resistentes .Me gustan mucho .Son del 9 mx , 11us  me quedan med numero mas grande por lo que tienes que comprar med talla menos o justo tu talla ."
"Muy buenos tennis.Los pedí tamaño 11 US y me quedaron muy bien, aunque si se pudiera los pediria medio número mas grande ya que su atractivo es el look que tienen al apretar en el empeine.En oferta se pueden conseguir a menos de $1000 pesos (MXN)10/10 Buen look."
Il buco dell'infradito è più largo del dovuto e indossando le ciabatte il piede va all'infuori. Inoltre fanno rumore quando cammini. Scarsa qualità della gomma
"Son de muy buena calidad pero vienen muy grandes. Tengo varios puma 11.5 y me quedan perfectos, solo estos me quedaron como un número completo más grande."
Fanno male gli attacchi delle cinghie sotto i piedi
"Padrísimos!!Están muy bonitos, el color como se muestra, la entrega rapidísima, muy cómodos y a muy buen precio."
Vanno benissimo!
"Llego antes de tiempo, mequedan como guante, si lo tullo es correr y quieres que esten firmes lo están, se amoldan a tu pie, los quiere para caminar y estar cómodos compra un medio o una talla mas de tu pie."
Perfette!
"Excelentes tenis a un excelente precio, el envío como siempre calidad amazon! Vienen un poco grandes pero si tienes el pie ancho, no arriesgues y pide tu número de siempre."
"Ich habe eine falsche Größe erhalten, vermute ich"
Muy bonitos y la calidad súper!!
Nickel👍
"Llegó antes de lo estimado y me sorprendió,  la calidad de Puma como siempre, no defrauda. Muy cómodos y a la medida. Recomendables 100%"
"Me encantaron desde el momento en que los saque de la caja,los e usado por un tiempo y no son icomodos,tienen muy bonito estilo se ve que son de muy buen material si recomendaria este producto ."
Ponganmelos en oferta por favor
"I bought these to replace FootJoy Tour S shoes that I loved but wore out. I think these shoes are just okay. Not all that comfortable, but not necessarily uncomfortable. I think the quality of the construction is just okay. The quality of the grip of the spikes is excellent."
These are very comfortable and stylish golf shoes. I love them
Had stitches popping out other than that beautiful shoe.
Unica pecca e per questo non ho messo 5 stelle è che è leggermente larga la striscia e mio figlio non ha il piede ben fermo nella ciabatta.
Schnelle Lieferung und gute Passform. Ideal für Urlaub und Garten.
Muy bonitos pero tallan súper pequeño
"Sono ben fatte e resistenti! Mio figlio le indossa da solo facilmente,bellissime..e se non le avete prese le consiglio!"
Dieser Schuh sieht toll aus aber leider viel zu klein. Meine Tochter hat Schuhgröße 33 und die Schuhe in 34/35 waren ihr zu klein. Fällt eher aus wie eine 32.
A mi me encantaron para mi bebé aunque me mandaron una talla mas grande
"Ya no me sorprende que el producto esté hecho en china. Pero el precio es muy accesible, la calidad no tan buena por lo delgada de la sueña."
Están de Lux hermosos
"Está muy padre, solo que me mandaron un número y medio más grande 🤔"
Es justo como los esperaba
Muy cool!
"I bought these for my 4 year old. He has a pair of other slip on sneakers that are similar and worn out! I ended up ordering these 1.5 sizes bigger than his other shoes, due to the other ones getting small, and from previous puma experience, they always seem to run small! I probably would have been better off only ordering a 1/2 size or 1 whole size bigger, because these shoes flap in the back when he walks! Because of this, I am unsure if these really do run small or are true to size! My 4 year old said they are very comfortable though, and they do have a nice thick cushion inside! The only thing I am not sure I like or not since he hasn't worn them out, is the tongue in the shoe. It doesn't pull up very far and I am not sure if it is going to bother him or not! I ended up getting these for a great price so all in all I think they were worth every penny, and I hope he gets some wear out of them soon! They really are cute!"
"Me encantaron los zapatos, los compré para mi hijo de 4 años 6 meses y la talla es correcta para el con las medidas de la tabla de tallas. Además los zapatos no tienen cordones reales, son elásticos lo q hace más sencillo q mi hijo se ponga solo los zapatos... eso me encanto xq cuando los compré pensé q debía amarrarse los cordones"
"These run a bit tight, but I exchanged for a bigger size. Assuming you’ll be wearing socks and your preference( thicker socks) I would go with a 1/2 size larger to a whole size larger, I usually wear thicker athletic socks so I ordered 1 size larger!"
Shoes are very cool and like most pumas which run small these do to. I’m normally a 13 had to get 14. But since I knew that in advance these were perfect!
Buena calidad
Size 10 2EE Red Wing work boots for years…all other shoes I wear are size 10….but this has to be upsized a 1/2 size.
"Runs small, nice looking boot but not worth the money. Cheap insole, felt cheap to be honest. Walked in em for about 5 min there isn’t much cushion even tho they look as though they would be a very soft ride I was disappointed."
Purchased my usual size 9EE and could barely get my foot in the shoe because it was so narrow.  Another time wasting purchase...
I bought the double wide but it was still to small.
Seems well made.
Love this boot. I wear Irish Setter Wingshooters for work every day so I tried these boots for hiking. The first pair was pretty small so I ordered a full size larger. 11 to 12. Nice fit.
"These shoes are really cute.  Unfortunately, not only are they too long (I wear an 8 1/2 D and I ordered an 8), but they are also not a true wide.  The bottom of the shoe is not wide and does not fully support the foot.  The shoe does appear to be able to stretch so it would give more room in the toe box, but unfortunately my foot would hang over the side and not be supported by the bottom.  Sadly, I am returning them."
"Los tenis son muy ligeros, lo cual es excelente para caminar o hacer actividades físicas durante un tiempo considerable. La plantilla de memory foam, por lo que son cómodos para andar, correr o realizar labores de trabajo en las cuales debes estar de pie mucho tiempo.Tengo seis meses usándolos para correr y caminar todos los días y siguen estando en perfecto estado."
Muy buena adquisicion. mi esposa esta super contenta. Son muy comodos y no se cansa con ellos. Si los volveria a comprar
"Super bonitos!!!Vienen como medio número más grandes, pero supongo que si haces deportes, como correr, es lo ideal para tener mayor comodidad!!!"
"Encantada, la mejor compra, era justo lo que quería, el tamaño perfecto, precio increíble súper ligeros no pesan nada, están buenísimos"
Cómodos y duraderos
Me gustó el precio y material de los tenis. Excelente producto .
"MeGustaron demasiado,excelente compra"
muy bonitos y buena calidad me gustaron
Muy cómodos
Comodas y bonitas.
I'm still waiting for the item because I did exchange it but it'll be fit with my mom thank you do much
"Usados a diario para trabajar, 100% transpirables, llevaba tiempo buscando algo de esto porque en verano se me cocían los píes con cualquier tipo de zapato de trabajo, pero con estos ya no. Totalmente recomendable y a buen precio"
"Me quedó justo como lo esperaba. Por el grosor de la suela y tacón, hacen parecer más alto a quien los usa."
"Great shoe, a little tight in the heel but work all the same."
Very nice
"these have  excellent ride,  very comfortable  for daily runner"
"I'm a neutral runner and these shoes supposed to be for neutral pronation. They are more like stability shoes. The side guide rails greatly impeding the rolling transition to toe-off and control the natural motion of the foot. I have other Adidas shoes with boost midsole which I really like, but the boost midsole of these shoes feels completely different, dead, and nonresponsive. The upper is a thick and supportive but leaking dye. After the first run my white socks get dyed red. The tongue is kind of firm and uncomfortable. The comfort is average. If you are a neutral runner avoid these shoes by any means.Horrible running shoes!"
"These shoes are decent. I got them to match a warmup suit. They are not as comfortable as some other adidas running shoes. The upper seems a little stiff and not as breathable as other shoes. If you want a pair to match an outfit or for casual wear, they will probably meet most people's needs. If you plan to run in them, they will work but there are better options."
I love the fit of these running shoes.  I use them for all kinds of training from strength to boxing and MMA training. They fit according to size.  The shoe box (Toe area) is normal fit and the support is good.
"This is as good as Adidas gets. Comfy, stylish and high quality sneakers. It's getting harder to get classic styles like this."
Great product
"They are perfect. Look so good! My husband loves them, and I do too"
Loving this great shoes. Fit nicely. Great price. Well delivered. Box was intact when the item arrived.
I'm normally an 11 and had to order an 11.5 for this shoe. Other than that -  it's great!!!
Great shoes.  ordered for my son. Fits great. Held up well and he wears them everyday.
I needed a pair of shoes only for walking. These shoes are really comfortable. True to size and fast delivery.
"The was looked nice online but once you buy it and see, it's quiet different experience. The size is very small and doesn't fit, must buy bigger size."
"A la.vista el material , no se ve muy resistente,  esperare con el uso que tan durables son..en cuanto a comodidad tamaño y color... todo bien"
Bought it for my girlfriend and she loves them. Comfortable and light weight! Great product!!
Not the color I ordered. I ordered all white with black outlined strips so please becareful if you attemp to oder the all white cause your NOT going to get what you think your going to get. Pretty disappointed cause I was looking forward to them.. but they fit nice and are light weight on your feet. Gave it one star cause I had too give at least one
I’m a nurse and I use these as my shoes for work. They are so light weight and the memory foam is pretty supportive so they don’t make my feet ache even after three 12 hour shifts in a row. And they are super cute so that’s a plus! These will be my go to work shoes for a while!
Great shoe. Very comfortable and fit perfectly
"Update: Originally I had said this was a good shoe for a mild runner.  After using them for a few months, I developed major foot issues.  Once I stopped using them, and took a few weeks off my problems went away.  There’s not enough support and I cannot recommend them.  I went back to the more expensive Adidas and have had no problems.  I really wanted to like these."
"I ordered a 10 and they fit like an 11. My feet slide in them. Please try a smaller size. I have a feeling that these are classified as runners shoes so they run large.Weirdly, they lack foot support like the boost that I loved dearly. I had little support when walking. They are soft but lack support.The shoe quality feels very flimsy and poor. They feel crafted from rubber pool noodles and I can easily see the stripes becoming detached in a week. Very dissatisfied with the quality.The design is cool, execution is terrible."
"I love this brand and was shocked these did not fit. I got my usual size and they felt tight across the top of my foot and my heel was slipping as I walked. They feel a half size larger. Also, the color was odd. I purchase white with pink stripes, but the white looks more like a blue white. It seriously looks like the sneakers were put in the wash with a load of blue jeans and the color bled onto the sneakers. The pink stripes look a little cheesey. As if they can be peeled right off. They are not comfortable at all. The sole feels very thin and flat. Low quality."
Bought these shoes for my 4 yr old for vacation as she had outgrown all her other shoes. She wore them all of 10 hours spanning 3 days time. The outer part of the shoe began separating from the sole of the shoe by the 2nd day. I will now have to find her a new pair of shoes for when school starts 😣 These shoes did fit as expected and my child loved them. Too bad they won't last long.
After 1 week of use...these are falling apart.  Do not purchase these.  These shoes must only be meant to wear inside.
"Our child is growing out of shoes so fast that I hate to drop a ton of money on tennis shoes (no thank you $50 New Balances) so after searching for a while, I found these for $20. My child really needed a wide pair and those have been difficult to find, but I lucked out with these pair. They fit him very well and the velcro/strap on each shoe has been holding up. The bottom rubber grippers have kind of ""shed"" some from playing outside, etc but I'm happy as long as they don't fall apart till we go to the next size up, which will probably be in just a few months, lol."
"Couldn't pass them up since they were so inexpensive and from a really good brand. They are very bright which isn't normally my preference but my kid loves them, they are easy to spot when they aren't put away properly, and they are easy to get on & off. He was only 3 when I bought them, so easy on/off is still important for everyone's sanity."
"My 5 year old boy almost outgrows his size 12 shoes so I order 12.5 for him.  At first he was thrilled about the look and color of the shoes. After putting it on, he wanted to take it off right away because it's too small and tight for him. He has no wide feet. So I think the shoes are made too small. In addition, the bottom material does not provide any grip as described in other reviews. So it's a return for me."
I am so disappointed with the quality of these shoes.  They started pulling apart at the soles the first week she wore them and it’s only continued to get worse.  She’s only worn these for three weeks and I’m already looking for new shoes for her.  I have multiple pairs of Saucony shoes myself and have always been 100% pleased.  I am not sure if we just got a bad pair here or what happened.
This shoe literally has felt on the bottom. It is extremely slippery. The shoes are also quite small.
"My son loved these shoes. They were comfortable and a great color. Unfortunately one of the soles began falling apart after 3 months of use. I'm on my third try of gluing the flap back down, fingers crossed..."
My  7 yr old daughter picked them out and really liked them she says they are comfortable.
My kids wear Saucony shoes & this is the first poorly made pair we’ve had. She wore them one time & they are already splitting at the seam & gave her blisters.
"the sneaker looks good and seems to be well made  but even going up a size they still dont fit right went from size 11 to size 12 and they are still to short and tight around the toes, so if you buy these consider getting the wide version or going up a size and a half"
Excelente producto..hoy los puse a prueba y son muy cómodos.. el único detalle que  la caja de los tenis venia un poco maltratada pero de todo lo demás están perfectos..
"Hallo, passen Perfekt, habe 46ziger bestellt, die passen super, bestellt bloß nicht kleiner, dann werden sie bestimmt irgendwo drücken, ich bin sehr zufrieden, brauche nur noch einen schwarzen Edding"
"Niño feliz, buena calidad, precio muy bien, barato."
"El modelo está muy padre, el tamaño es el correcto para mí, original."
Top Service. Preis Leistung Top. Sehr zum Empfehlen.Super Freundlicher Kontakt antworten kommen sehr Schnell 😊💪
Excelente producto llegó a tiempo!!!
Me gustó el diseño y me quedo perfecto.
Me quedo perfecto unos tenis muy bonitos de excelente calidad justo lo que esperaba.
It’s the best shoe I have ever ordered on the Amazon. I love the design and how it fit.
Das Preis Leistungsverhältnis der Schuhe ist gut. Trage die Schuhe auf der Arbeit. Sie haben eine angenehme Sohle und das Netz ist gut belüftet. Wer einen günstigen Schuh sucht ist hier gut aufgehoben.
"Super Schuhe! Hab sie für den Job gekauft, da ich immer auf dem Beinen bin. Fühlen sich super leicht an und sind bequem. Ich hab sie in einer Nummer kleiner genommen und passen perfekt 😁 Bin zufrieden."
Sieht absolut Cool aus passt und ist bequem zu tragen macht man glaub ich nicht viel falsch mit
"Sono belle,  comode ed economiche.  Quello che cercavo!"
"Comprate per camminare , ottime"
Es una zapatilla bonita y con buena relación calidad precio. La pega es que talla pequeño y a mi hijo no le quedó. La devolvimos por eso y por no haber el número de arriba.
Leider verrutschte die innen SohleDie ich erst verkleben mussteAnsonsten Super
top
"Super bequem.Trage ich auf Arbeit 8-9 Stunden lang,keine Rückenschmerzen,keine Schweißfüße.Super Preis."
Mir hat's gefallen...

Happy husband happy wife!  He says they are feather light and very comfy.  Something we have grown to expect from this brand
The size shoes not same another shoes Skechers i have on 10 us fit in but yours too large
Just perfect !
"Excepcional zapatilla para correr en montaña. Buenas prestaciones subiendo, aunque no para pruebas verticales, buen agarre sea en subida sea reteniendo. Suela de retorno excepcional y pisada súper confortable.Upper fantástico y suficientemente ancho para entrenamiento o Carrera largos (más de cuatro horas). Mediopié y talón no tan estrechos como me gustaría, pero confortable y envolvente.Lengüeta tipo calcetín unido al upper, aunque fabuloso para evitar la entrada a la plantilla de piedras, arena y chinitas, pero tras muchas horas se acumulan en el fondo de la propia lengüeta que hace de “saco”.Los cordones serpentean por los ojales cosidos en los paneles laterales del upper. Esto unido a la elasticidad de los cordones ayuda mucho a relajar posibles estrecheces cuando el pie se “calienta” (ensancha).  El Mesh (laterales) evacuan bastante bien el calor de la zapatilla, pensé que con calor iban a ser un horno, pero no, airean correctamente, aunque para verano mejor mesh de verano en lugar de este (ideal primavera/otoño y días en que no superes los 30 grados y necesites gore). favorece la ventilación y el confort térmico. Suela muy amortiguada..., desconozco materiales.Suela Frixion Red.Drop de 7.Óptimo balance todo terreno, aunque mi uso será sencillamente correr cómodo, ni compito ni las llevo para caminar, son perfectas para lo que las compré, correr cómodo más de 3 horas sin problema. Para mí, Ideales para correr en pista o senda compacta de llana a desniveles medios, pero eso irá en “gustos” y sensaciones de cada corredor.Por el peso no me preocupo, en cuanto meto barro..., ya he ganado gramos, así que no me preocupa, pero son muy ligeras, aunque mi número, un 46 1/2 he cogido son más de 300 gramos.Calzo un 10 en zapato. Un 46 en zapatillas normales de correr y medio más para trail.Como los zapatos, procuro darles descanso 2 días, alternando con otras zapas. Guardarlas siempre limpias y con horma. Alarga la vida de la zapatilla.Relación calidad precio óptima.Vendedor al TOP: Cumplidor. Precio excepcional. Descripción adecuada y profesional. Sin duda un descubrimiento. Un vendedor TOP TOP."
"Ottimo prodotto. Una scarpa tecnica studiata appositamente per il trail running. Calza come un guanto, protettiva, la suola va dappertutto. Ottimo rapporto con il venditore. Consigliato."
Pues no puedo correr con ellas porque me hacen mucho daño en los píes porque es muy fina de delante y me duelen mucho los dedos.Llegando hacerme sangre en una de ellas.Por lo que me las he puesto dos veces y ya las tengo guardadas.
"la parte posteriore e' troppo alto e provoca fastidio al tendine d'achille in modo importante,mai successo su nessuna scarpa La Sportiva,ho dovuto renderle mio malgrado,per me inutilizzabili,sono rimasto molto deluso,pur apprezzando il marchio e tutti gli altri modelli che reputo eccezionali"
"Ottime per battistrada, calzabilità, stabilità, per il mio piede ci sono stati problemi ai talloni, i talloni delle scarpe me li hanno feriti, per cui sono per me un po' troppo duri e prominenti verso la punta; ho ovviato incerottandomi i talloni preventivamente prima di usarle."
"Son tallas muy pequeñas,si tienes el pie yn poco ancho una talla mas no siempre es suficiente.Muy mala experiencia con ellos.Aunque al principo los puse y me van justos, tampoco son comodos, al cabo de unos kilometros se hace insoportables y hacen mucho daño.Pues aqui los tengo, con 25 km y para tirar."
Like it
"I bought these shoes for my very active daughter (size 7), who has a wide arch. At first she wasn't sure she could get her foot in them, as they are one piece at the top, but they slightly stretched to accommodate, and fit her perfectly. She loves the color, and tells me they are very comfortable.  RECCOMENDED!"
La puntualidad del pedido
"BE AWARE THAT SIZES RUN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. I always wear a 7.5 in tennis shoes but wear a 7 in these. They fit perfectly.  I love that these are slightly wider so they don't squeeze my feet too hard (like Nike's sometimes can). They can take a little bit of time to stretch out but fit amazingly once they do. I already have a pair of the all black Adidas Alphabounce & I love them so much I had to get a gray pair as well!  They're high quality & I've gotten lots of compliments on them. Pictures were taken after a month & a half of use & they still look brand new, they're awesome shoes!"
"I’m 90% sure these are fake. I have owned other Alphabounces before, and what I liked about them was the light, pillowy sole. The sole of these shoes are dense and heavy, like it’s made of recycled plastic or something. The fit is terrible, very wide and loose on my feet (and I have wide feet!). All together they just don’t look or feel legit. I will be returning them right away"
I read a lot of good reviews about this shoe on the adidas website and how comfortable and soft it is but was very disappointed when i tried them on. They are bulky and hard and the outsole is super wide making your feet look way bigger than they actually are. Because they're so hard it almost makes me question if these are authentic?
"These are not actually Adidas. I have 2 other pairs of Adidas and just liked the color of these. They came in an Adidas box, but the shoe was a fraud. And was way larger than it should have been."
"At first glance I loved the shoes! Once I put them on and looked down at them, I didn't like them near as much. The soles are super wide. But they are very comfy and very light weight so I didn't return them. Now after a few weeks of having these shoes I'm glad I kept them--they've grown on me and love the way the feel."
"I ordered a full size smaller like the reviews say- that was a mistake. It was very snug and hard to get on at first since the tounge is connected to the rest like a thick snug sock. I suggest ordering only a half size down. Also something weird- there’s good support on the heel but when you move from heel to toe (like running), the outer toes’ soul is thinner than the big toe and feel uneven, like stepping halfway on a crack."
"I ordered these a 1/2 size down as was recommended in the reviews, but they were still too big. I returned them for a whole size smaller and they fit better. The only thing I did not like was that they made my feet look huge. They are wide. I wear my workout shoes with yogas so these shoes made my feet look like I had elephant feet. I returned them and went with a pair of NB. These are a good deal, but if you are not a fan of fat shoes, these are not for you."
"Best shoes I’ve ever bought sight unseen and not tried on first. My shoe size is normally 10.5 wide but I ordered an 11 and they fit perfectly. I ordered another pair in grey. I have ongoing battles with shoes normally due to one foot having a fallen arch and pain in the heel, so it makes it hard to find comfortable shoes that will make both feet comfortable. I’ve never owned a pair of Adidas before so it’s nice that the shoes fit right out of the box and are comfortable,"
"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Che dire! Non ho parole perché sono bellissime.Mio figlio le adore, hanno lucine colorate che puoi spegnere ed accendere, rosa, giallo, verde e azzurro.Si ricaricano come il cellulare"
Aufgrund der Ladenschliessungen mussten wir leider diesmal im Internet Kinderschuhe bestellen.Optisch sehen Sie aus wie auf den Bildern und gepasst haben sie auch. Auch die LED Lichter sind ein Highlight und funktionieren.Nun sind sie schon ca 2 Monate in Gebrauch und vorne löst sich schon der Kleber. Auch quietschen und knarzen die Schuhe bei jedem Schritt was störend ist.Würden diese Schuhe zu diesem Preis nicht noch einmal kaufen.
Passen perfekt und die Lichter sind super!
Great shoe.  Nice update from the Anthem 2.  Perfect shoe for my 17 year old son who uses it as his everyday shoe as well as his running shoe.  He loves this style in the Brooks line because it provides the perfect amount of support for his flatter feet.  He hates the tennis shoes that have high arch support.
"my feet, big problem, been thru many different brands of shoes, need wide shoe, now with arthritis in toes problem even bigger....attracted to these because of the entire mesh topping, right out of the box, a little tight, stuffed toe box with paper for week, my feet now feel so good when i put these on.  moderate arch support but comfortable,  senior female finding comfort in men's shoes, didnt even need to buy wide as men's normal shoes are size D, these are a good deal if looking for a reasonably priced Brooks shoe, i think i may be buying Brooks from now on."
"I've been wearing brooks running shoes for about 10 years, these being my fifth or sixth pair....sadly these haven't held up for even 4 months before getting a hole on the side. Never had a problem with Brooks running shoes before, so I'm very disappointed.  They are still usable at the moment, but it's only a matter of time before I'll need a new pair and these get thrown out.*UPDATE* I was able to get in contact with Brooks & they sent me a newer version of these shoes, FREE OF CHARGE! I'm hoping these hold up better than the ones I wrote the review on."
"Unfortunately my first Pair of Brooks I have giving a bad rating. The cushion and bottom sole is wearing out already. Im 6’3” 220, not over weight. They should have a least held up another month😣"
"My son has worn the Brooks Ravenna for a few years due to extreme over pronation. We ventured out to try a new style, the Anthem. These look like nice shoes, but they offered no arch support at all for him (his feet over probate more than average, so it may not be the shoe but may just be his crazy feet)."
"I discovered Brooks about 3 years ago.  Only brand I wear.  I am a dogwalker and do at least 5 miles per day, so I know what I’m talking about!"
"These shoes fit well, are comfortable, and are very light. They are a great walking or running shoe."
"This is my third pair of the exact same shoe. After breaking 6 bones in my foot a few years ago, running has been painful. The Anthem line has allowed me to run pain free. Great cushion, great durability, great fit."
"These shoes are very comfortable and are extremely lightweight. I’ve found that Brooks shoes are some of the best athletic shoes and these shoes work just as great as the others I’ve worn. They fit as expected and are very comfortable, even while being broken in"
"Great walking sneakers, I don't run in Brooks, just not my running shoe.I found them very comfortable fro walking. They provide enough support and just enough softness without being spongy. Also, classy looking IMO, this particular color scheme."
"El producto es bueno y de calidad,pero en cuestión de las tallas son confusas, seleccione una talla de 26.50 cm y la talla que me trajeron fue la 6 1/2 US, que es la equivalente a la talla de 25 cm, por suerte lo pude usar como regaloPero si deben mejorar esto, ya que no especifica si la selección de la talla que traen es en cm o pulgadas"
I will start by saying I love ASICS shoes and buy them exclusively as my workout shoes.This pair was a little less expensive. I thought I was getting a deal but they aren’t really on par with what I’ve had in the past. Not a lot of support for the foot in the front of the shoe and not a lot of tread/grip on the sole. Not good for running or walking in even slightly wet conditions as they slip very easily. Ok for the treadmill.Will get a slightly higher end pair of ASICS next time.
Los compré para regalo de cumple de mi sobrina y le encantaron! Son sus tenis favoritos... Llegaron a tiempo y la calidad es la que distingue a Asics
"la calidad es muy buena, en tiempo de engrega fue muy rapida, gracias por su profesionalismo"
Muy cómodas.
"La talla es perfecta, cómodos para correr"
"Used for an indoor shoe, and daily use, this was exactly what my wife wanted."
Excelente producto
It is OK but not very great shoe.
Muy bonito par de tenis
"Calidad muy buena,muy agradables y suaves, aunque debería recoger mejor el talón, más acolchado me refiero, porque a mi hijo le baila algo el pie por detrás por tener el pie demasiado delgado.En el primer envío vino la caja de la talla 33 con una sandalia de la talla 33 y otra de la talla 30. Hice la devolución. Suerte que había más."
"Comme toujours, la qualité est au Rdv avec Kickers. Très confortables, elles maintiennent parfaitement le pied : indispensable pour un p'tit gars qui court tout le temps !Contrairement à une précédente évaluation, ce modèle taille parfaitement. Prendre donc la pointure habituelle..."
"Chaussures très confortables, cuire souple, très bonne qualité."
Je trouve que ce modèle taille petit par rapport à un autre modèle acheté il y a quelques années de taille 31. Celles commandées ici était de taille 33 et en les comparant avec mon ancienne taille 31 il n'y avait quasiment pas de différences. Dommage car la qualité était impeccable. La livraison a été super rapide.
Le modèle à été essayé en magasin avant.Content de la solidité.Modèle encore plus neuf qu au magasin car jamais essayé par personne.
"Bien que chère, article de bonne facture."
Mon fils les adore. Idéal pour l'été. Des sandales efficaces pour toutes les sorties des prochains mois estivales. Parfait pour un petit garçon
"Ich habe Schuhgröße 50 und bin eigentlich immer beim schauen, obs was günstiges für meine Füße zum Anziehen gibt. Ich hab diese Kappa durch Zufall entdeckt und ein Paar für ca 28€ bestellt. Zügig geliefert, probiert, für gut befunden und 2 weitere Paare bestellt. Zur Haltbarkeit kann ich nichts dagenHab sie ein Paar mal im Wald getragen und zur Arbeit. Es wird sichnrausstellen wie lang sie halten. Allerdings muss man den Preis auch berücksichtigen. Wenn sie ein halbes Jahr bei normaler Nutzung halten bin ich schon zufrieden."
"Sehr schöne Schuhe,  als sie angekommen sind haben wir gleich ein zweites Paar in Größe 50 bestellt."
Passt wie angegossen und laufen sich prima
"Mein Freund hat immer Schwierigkeiten Schuhe in seiner Größe zu finden, weil er 50 trägt. Oft muss man dann Abstriche in der Optik machen. Die hier haben nicht nur gepasst, sondern sehen auch echt toll aus"
Passt wackelt und hat Luft
super
Ottime comode e leggere! Arrivate con 2 giorni di anticipo!
"sehr gut, leicht und Sohle biegsam"
Sind zwar bequem aber sind auch schnell kaputt und quitschen und knacken schon nach kurzer Zeit. Sohle ging schnell kaputt
Super
"You have to size up, I am usually 6 but I ordered 6.5 on these and they look super cute, they’re very comfy, love the color too!"
"Bought these for my husband, but had to return. Looks like a great shoe but has a very small opening for your foot to get in."
"I am thinking about sending them back i put them on and headed to the store. I wear a 13, i ordered a 14 like they recommend. I had to take them off while I was driving. There are 2 white lace type materials that squeeze your foot and causes the issue.I also had trouble putting them on even at a size bigger. I had to put them on, on the back of my truck to get enough leverage to get them on.I took the shoe from a 1 star to a 4 star. In my photos you'll notice the white lace eyelet. Remove the shoe string all the way, then cut the white lace. Its actually sewen to the inside of the shoe which is why it gets so friggin tight. Then feed your shoe string through one of the holes where the white lace was and lace them like normal shoes. They over thought this for too long. I have the JJ2s and theyre tight too. JJ3s arent as tight with what modification i mentioned above."
"Never got to wear them in, or do anything relevant for a good review on these. I LOVE this style - wish it worked out differently because they look so cool. Love the gum bottom and the shoe is a tank. Very stable and solid - what would be perfect for a training/gym shoe.The reviews are absolutely true - due to the unadjustable lacing, makes it hard to squeeze into. Order a 1/2 size larger at least.I’m returning, not exchanging, mainly because the shoe is built narrow and a 1/2 size bigger (longer) won’t really remedy my issue.Great if you have the right foot - I just didn’t personally."
"Size 8 and Chalk/Black/Reebok Rubber Gum-great fit. I’m a woman and I usually wear a size 9. Flexible, not too much cushion so I can squat and feel the ground well. I have a wider foot so men’s sneakers fit better. Very comfortable to wear.-great style. I feel so confident wearing these!!-easy to slip on and off. With no damage to the back of the shoe I can tie once and slip on and off easilyOverall I love these sneakers, might be my favorite to date. I’ve had them for a month with no issues."
"Fits lengthwise once on my foot, but very difficult to get on. Entry is super tight. I have to use a shoe horn! It also has inflexible bands across the widest part of the foot as a design feature. Very tight and no way to loosen them."
"Got these for mountain biking and working out, and they do both well. Tread seems durable and sticks to pedals and any other surface like glue. The sole is relatively stiff for stability but is still flexible enough to be very comfortable. Only concern for some would be how snugly these shoes fit. On my very narrow feet, they fit great, but I suspect they'd be too tight for many people."
"Better looking picture than actual product. Fits smaller and tighter and the little stripe that runs across it, kills the shoe. I thought O could look past that,  but couldn't. Returned them."
They fit perfect for me though I have narrow feet. If you otherwise have wider feet I don’t recommend this product. Great stability for weight lifting and alike exercises.
These things suck to put on! The shoe laces are for show. Once they're on your feet they feel like a good shoe for jogging or just casual wear. They look great with athletic attire.
"great fit, comfortable"
"Ran small/narrow. My husband loves the JJ watt 2s but these fit different. Still nice and have to a family member, just size up"
"I just wish more sizes where available. I really needed one size bigger, but it wasn’t an option so I had to settle with the size I got. They’re very nice shoes and my son thinks they’re comfortable."
"After 3 months or so, these were in pieces, but that might be expected since my son plays quite a bit of soccer.  Otherwise, good fit and nice shoe."
Love the product
I brought these shoes for my son but after seeing them I did not like them at all.
Great shoe for school uniform!  Comfortable and a style my son likes
igual que en la foto
"Excelentes. Calzan un número más. Por lo menos en mi caso, aunque el número indicado en la suela es el que me corresponde, al calzarla resulta un número más."
Deporte tal cual se describe.. número tal cual pides..cómodos..bonitos y bien de precio..recomendable
Era un regalo . Las zapatillas muy cómodas
Perfecto producto...y el precio imbatible
"I ordered the 13 wide. My foot is probably a 12.5 Wide. The inner curve of the toe area doesn't give quite enough room. The grey color and white dot design is good. I liked the material. An issue is the rubber heel piece grabs onto my pants repeatedly and makes a noise. The footbed is pretty cushy and neutral. No heel problems. If there is any problem with a shoe I have to send it back, and this one had two for me. These were an almost, so they will probably work for someone else."
"Good:Comfortable, easy to take on and off, good fit, looks nice.Bad:Low quality materials. They seem very fragile and cheaply made. Also, the rubber is not very grippy. I would not trust these for actual trail running or serious outdoor use.Summary:For around $40 these are good value for a shoe to wear around town but do not expect a durable trail runner."
"I love hiking in these. They have great traction and are super bouncy thanks to the fresh foam. I have the brown ones so they also match with my camping/hiking gear. Putting them on is a bit awkward because of the shape, but that doesn't really bother me since I enjoy wearing them so much. Would definitely buy again. Slightly snug so you won't go wrong ordering a half size up depending on how you like your shoe to fit."
Difficult to slide foot in - back I’d show suppler is pushed in and runs up against heel all day - you can actually see the divot on back of shoe -Horrible purchase - I will forever be “Off  Balance “” in the future. #asics want a new customer ?
I've had three pair of this design shoe i wish New Balance would go back to this design. I bought the design that replaced this one and it just isn't the same.
It’s a slip on shoe and hard to put on. The material stays dirty after you wash it and overall a bad shoe. Rubs on your ankles and gives blisters
Love the look and design of the shoe. The sole is solid enough for hiking in rugged terrain but still comfortable. The suede look and color are stylish.
"The reviews I've read or complaints about  a slip-on type shoe, but if you know your feet and can use slip-on type shoes these are great. There is no pressure at the tongue you can actually use the laces to get a snug fit. Very comfortable."
Love these sneaks. I work in them 10 hrs/5 days a week on roofs and ladders. My feet thank me every day.
I got 2 pairs and love them !!
"My daughter absolutely loves Converse shoes and she loves the color of these slip on shoes EXCEPT her feet slip out of the shoes. They are the right size but they are also a bit heavy so her heels come up at every step. She can only wear them with really thick socks. We are going to have to put shoe laces in the shoes which defeats the purpose of the slip on. If you want the shoes because of the slip on feature, then I do not recommend."
"I had to return them because the size seemed a little off. They were exactly what I wanted, just too big. I usually wear a women's US 6.5 and ordered these in size 4.5 ""older kids."" They fit more like a women's US 7 or maybe even 7.5."
conforme con la compra
"Fit exactly as expected, for converse. Converse are men's sized, so ordering 2 sizes smaller, if you are ordering for a girl will work perfectly! They are awesome!!!!!"
They are very nice and the kids love them. They run just a little big but that's OK because it was for a kiddo and they will grow into them.
"Amzing Shoes, My Daughter love it so much with bright colors & very good quality"
"Had no idea converse run so large( but I didn't read the reviews, so maybe I should have. Bought a size 3 for my daughter thinking they would be a little big (she's a 2 in other shoes) but ended up having to buy another pair that is a 1.5... and she still has lots of room."
Very cute. My 5 yr old loves them.  They do run a tad big
Fit as expected and super cute
These are great shoes but they do run big so make sure you order a size smaller to get the right size.
"This product was not a good fit. Since we are stationed abroad, returning or exchanging for a more appropriate size is quite difficult."
"Great shoe, to bad COVID-19 canceled all sports. Hope they fit for next year."
"Eccellente prodotto, lo consiglio vivamente"
I bought these for the start of school and 1.5 months later they have holes in front. Very disappointed by this model. My son is 6 but a shoes should last more than 2 months...
"I got this for my daughter, and it was true to size. She doesn’t have to lace it which is perfect. She’s super active as most kids that age, and it’s her go-to shoe, so she definitely puts it through the test. It’s still holding up. I would buy again in the next show size."
These shoes run much more narrow than any other New Balance running shoe.  I wear NB running shoes all the time but these were too narrow and actually hurt my feet as a result.  Ended up donating them.
"I got them for a little girl’s birthday. She loves shoes and she loved these ones, tried then on and started running around and showing them to everyone."
Cute shoes BUT I was looking for regular tie shoes so we returned them. Good quality though and true to size for someone who doesn’t want tie shoes.
These shoes fit my daughter well and she says they are “super cute and comfy”.  Fits as expected.
I love how light they are for my 2.5 year old. They seem comfortable and overall the purchase turns out to have been worth. I hope they last. We’ve only been wearing them for 2 weeks now so we’ll see
"This colors on this shoe look fabulous in person, but both the 5.5 and the size 6 were too narrow top to bottom in the toe box for my kid's feet-- not roomy at all. My kid is currently a size 5.5 and moving into a 6. We'll choose a different style. This one runs small."
"Super cute, but the laces are pretty long."
My daughter loves these sneakers and the fit. They do run small so you need to size up
My daughter loved them.
"Las zapatillas son buenas, pero pido una talla 36 y esperé más de una semana para estar disponibles para ser enviadas. Recibí talla 20.Estoy completamente decepcionado"
"Magnifique paire de chaussures de fête, de cérémonie,… Solide et élégant à la fois. Facile à entretenir… et la qualité Geox permet de revendre en seconde main car ce genre de chaussures n’est jamais porté au quotidien !"
"Nice boots. They are a gift for my son, I am very pleased with these beautiful boots! This type of boot comes with the concealed, carry option which was unexpected, but cool."
"Su suela es buenísima, siento la diferencia al caminar. No son tan transpirables por lo mismo de que son impermeables, para tomarlo en cuenta. La plantilla que traen es muy acolchada y cómoda, por lo regular el calzado nuevo cansa, pero este no, fue ponerselos y caminar a gusto."
"Los compre porque tengo un cuidado especial en la cadera y todos los días camino 1 hora con mi perro, en verdad mi paseo se ha hecho muy placentero con estos tenis tan suaves , se ajustan perfecto ,en ellos encontré la comodidad y suavidad que había buscado desde hace mucho tiempo, se los recomiendo mucho."
Excelente calidad y llegada a tiempo
The shoes work as both a trail shoes as well as walking shoes.
"I liked the materials, color, comfortability and support for my feet. I use them to walk outside or workout at home."
"With good support and light weight, this walking shoe is well worth the reasonable price."
Great fit and durable.
Shoes are very comfortable and are a good fit. Typically a 10.5 size but usually order 10 in skechers. will buy again when these wear out.
LOVE THEM. MY HUSBAND LOVES THEM.
Great looking and feeling shoes.
"Das Produkt wurde 1 Woche von einem gehenden 14 Monate alten Kind getragen und vorne haben beide Schuhe ein Loch. Der Zwilling trägt Schuhe derselben Firma (anderes Modell) und diese haben normale Abnutzungen. Ich bestelle seit Jahren Superfit und bin zum ersten Mal wirklich unzufrieden. Ich habe bereits reklamiert und bin gespannt,ob dies funktioniert."
"Schöne Schuhe aber leider die Weite stimmt nicht mit der Beschreibung. Ich finde die Schuhe sehr eng und nicht Mittelweit.Sehr schöne Muster , hätte nur Angst das nach 2 mal anziehen die Schuhe ausschauen wie sehr alt. Würde empfehlen hier die vorher zu imprägnieren."
"Leider zu schmal für meine Tochter.Sonst hätte er mir richtig gut gefallen. In der Sohle ist eingezeichnet wie lang er passt, einfach mal rausnehmen und Kind (abends) draufstellen.Leider ragt bei uns der kleine Zeh aber über die Breite hinaus."
Der Schuh ist super für Jungs mit schmalen Füßen geeignet. Die Sohle ist biegsam und man kann diese auch drehen. Ist aber kein Barfußschuh. Perfekt für den alltäglichen Gebrauch und auch für Ausflüge in die Natur geeignet
"Es sah aus, als hätte mein Kind nasse Füße - aber innen drin waren die Socken trocken und die Füße schön warm. Wir bestellen immer super fit, Winter, Sommer, Sandalen, alles super."
Die Schuhe sind sehr robust denn sie müssen bei unserem Sohn eine ganze Menge aushalten. Sie sind Wasser fest aber nicht wasserdicht. Für Regenwetter oder eine nasse Wiese perfekt geeignet
"Sehr schöne Schuhe von Superfit, wie immer in sehr guter Qualität. Kaufen gerne Superfit und sind auch seit Jahren zufrieden damit. Können die Schuhe klar empfehlen."
"Nachdem unser Sohn die Schuhe 2,5 Monate getragen hat ist ein ca. 1 cm großes Loch im Leder. Wir sind von superfit sonst bessere Qualität gewohnt - für den preis haben wir mehr erwartet..."
"Sehr guter Schuh, der jetzt schon einiges durch gemacht hat. Tretauto, Sand, fahrrad, Laufrad, spazieren Gehen, uvm. Teils stark teils weniger stark beansprucht. Dennoch sieht er nach etwas abbürsten gut aus."
"Meiner Tochter und mir gefällt der Schuh sehr gut, er passt perfekt und ist sehr gut verarbeitet. Preisleistung ist auch mehr als in Ordnung"
"EDIT: After daily wearing them for the past 4 months they have held up great! The cusion in the sole is wearing down but all in all they are holding up well! I’ve put them thru hell and back and still love them! 10 / 10 will buy another pair when these goSuper comfy! Way better than my Walmart bought non-slips, with my old shoes my feet would be so sore afterwork I would have to sit in my car for 10-15 minutes after putting my runners on and before driving 30 min home, these are great! Could use more cushion in the soles but nothing Dr. Sholl’s can’t fix, can’t speak for longevity as have only had them 1 day, will update review if I find and faults and will update biased on longevity"
"Very good work shoes, feet barely hurt at the end of 9 hour work day. I even wear these as my regular shoes sometimes and they are very nice/ cushiony. If u have wider than average feet (i do) then id still pick regular unless theyre real wide cause i got the wides and not too too big, but def a little too much room. Overall best shoes ive ever bought. They look like nmds but theyre sketchers lol"
"Ordered size 11 Wide. Generally I’m a size 11, but forgot when I actually get a proper wide pair of shoes I can go down half a size, maybe even a full size. Fits fine, a bit loose, but used some old draw string cords to help tighten the ‘laces’."
I ordered the same size I usually take and it was a little bigger but I didn’t mind that and they are very super comfortable and work really good in the fast food Industry with the slippery floors
This is an excellent product and I will purchase it again. It's very comfortable. The bungee type laces ensure that I never have to bend over and tie shoe laces.
"I’ve had sketchers wide before and they were amazing, but these are very narrow. Not wide at all. Also the shoe does not breathe, socks will be soaking wet and gross."
"J'ai pris des 9 au lieu de 9,5 habituellement et ils font très bien. Je suis préposé à l'entretien ménager et les souliers sont ""slip resistant"". Ça fonctionne très bien sur un plancher mouillé. Les souliers ne sont pas magiques par contre, sur de la glace ou un plancher très poussiéreux ce sera quand même glissant..."
"NO NO NO is not a ""Breathable mesh""Everything it was according to description but ... is real plastic mesh and your foot it looks like is inside OVEN.choose something else"
"They’re not the COMFIEST shoes (comfiest meaning “walking on air”), but they’re pretty darn close. I’ve been wearing them for my waiter shifts and they prevent slips, they’re light, they’re breathable, and pretty comfy. Highly recommend for waiters and waitresses 100%:)"
"Very good for working in a kitchen for long hours on hard floors. Will say they do feel a little more loose after wearing them for about 6 months , but overall a very nice shoe and highly recommend"
Unfortunately they don't last . 10 weeks and the metal bindings on straps fail making the sandal unwearable. It's too bad as Clark's name used to mean quality.
"I bought these in Oct 2020 for summer 2021. After only 2 weeks of wear this spring 2021 (stay at home orders in Canada), the metal link/buckle has worn right through the leather heel strap making them unfixable. (This is our 3rd pair of Clark's Sandals and we have never had a problem before).Very disappointed."
"en medio del envió se regreso el producto, no llego nunca."
"Nice looking, good quality leather sandals. I had Clarks before that lasted me almost 20 years. Hopefully these are the same."
Well made.
They are comfortable and did not require a break-in period.
Great sandals have owned six pair of this model in the past and loved every one!
They were every thing I expected
"Comfortable but cheaply constructed. The clip which holds the rear of the right sandal to the side broke today after only a month of intermittent use. My last Clarks lasted a decade, evidently quality has slipped. Pay more and avoid this now unacceptable brand.(Edit, Oct '20) Amazon's outstanding customer service exchanged the broken pair for another, which broke today, only a few months of light use later, with the same issue. I'm out $80 on a lousy purchase. Dropping rating to one star and will not under any circumstances purchase Clarks again."
"I've been wearing these kind of Clark's sandals for over 20 years.  I think Clark's has slipped a bit on the quality control of this model though.  The first pair that came fit fine.  They felt good, but before even 30 days expired, the metal loop that holds the back strap to the side broke clean off.  No problem, everyone can have a bad day, right?As expected the return process was clean and easy.  I re-ordered the same model thinking I had a bad apple and they came very quickly.I decided I'd loosen the back strap up a little, just in case I was putting too much pressure on the metal loop.  Nope!  Within three weeks, the same thing happened.  This is clearly a poor design.I still like Clark's.  But they have a clunker here.  I do NOT recommend this product."
These shoes are super comfortable and really cute.  Best purchase ever!  They fit true to size.
"Acquisto effettuato approfittando di un'offerta. La scarpa è molto carina peccato che una cucitura sulla punta, durante la camminata, batte sul mignolo del piede e dopo un po' fa veramente male. Probabilmente è un problema che dipende dalla mia conformazione, per il resto la scarpa è comoda e la calzata regolare"
"Eran bonitas y parecían cómodas, pero las devolví porque calzaban pequeñastendría que pedir 2 tallas mas"
Dr.Brinkmann Schuhe sind sehr zu empfehlen.Gute Verarbeitung und zum Guten Preis
Muy buenos zapatos y la piel es auténtica y muy suave con los pies.
"Bought these for working in a restaurant kitchen and I think they are some of the best kitchen specific shoes that I've seen in 20 plus years of being a chef. Size fits as it should. They looks good, feel good and seem as though they will last. They are actually slightly more slippery than other non slip shoes I've worn but not problematic. I have a colleague with an old pair of these and he also likes them. Will probably buy another pair when the time comes"
This shoe allows me to use it interchangeably. I wear it casually when Im out and about. I'll also wear it around the house a I exercise.  I like the leather.  The footbed works for me.  I find the cost to be too high for what you get.  Perhaps an additional inner sole to take up the stretch as the shoe wears in.  I would buy them again.
"Wie gewohnt - Top Qualtät von Merrell. Bei der Bestellung auf die Größe achten (Amazon.com, Lieferung aus den USA). Zweimal Größe 48EUR bestellt, zweimal wurde Größe 49EUR geliefert. Erst die Bestellung in Größe 47EUR war erfolgreich - geliefert wurde jetzt die gewünschte Größe 48EUR."
Since the shoe has no back if the front is too wide they just fall off.  For a medium it’s quite wide.  Went back.
Shoes are nice. My husband preferred brown but it was not available. Good slipons for a person with wide and with a high instep.
Fabulous comfort.  Love them!
"Comfortable, comfortable, comfortable!!! All leather great quality!!!"
Good shoes
Cómo te estos zapatos pero llegaron muy grandes y solicité la devolución desde el 24 de octubre y es fecha que no han pasado a recoger el paquete
Liked that it was advertised as it was.
"Me llegaron mucho más rápido de lo que decía Amazon, y son extremadamente cómodos. Cuando caminas se siente cómo el aire pasa atraves de tus tennis, o sea que sí tiene el supuesto filtro de aire. Los he usado en montaña, camino rudo y terracería y en todo momento me han demostrado ser muy resistentes. Los he torcido al caminar (accidentalmente) y en ningún momento han mostrado señal de despegarse o desgarrarse. Los colores son muy vivos y se ven de buena calidad para el precio que tienen. Tampoco se ven uff, l o s  t e n n i s, no, pero sí se ven ""de mejor gama que la media"".Lo que dicen de que hay que pedirlos media talla de la que eres para que te queden bien, es verdad. yo soy 7 y los pedí 6.5. Me quedaron a la medida, eso sí, si quieres que te sobre un poco de espacio entonces no te recomiendo hacer eso y pídelo tal cual tu número.  Mi PERO es que son extremadamente resbaladizos en cemento o piedra mojada. La suela parece un jabón cuando llueve. Iba a comprarlos otra vez, pero ya no. Literalmente arriesgas tu vida o mínimo quebrarte un hueso si te agarra la lluvia a medio trail. Entonces cuidado. Inclusive creo que en casa con el piso trapeado te podrías andar resbalando entonces es un buen punto a tomar en cuenta."
"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Me gustó mucho. Eh tenido muchos skechers pero ninguno como estos, la comodidad es superior a todos los anteriores que he tenido.Sobre el tamaño, me quedó un poquito grande, pero todo bien. Mi sugerencia es pedir medio número más pequeño de lo que realmente eres"
"Creo que son de los mejores tennis que he utilizado, en tiendas acá en Mexico, está clase de modelos están en el doble de precio ($2,500), pero aquí encuentras súper ofertas. El único tema es que los míos vinieron amplios y tuve que pedir un número menos"
"Son muy cómodos por el tipo de platilla que tiene y la dureza de suela, proporcionando comodidad durante el día y al caminar durante mucho tiempo"
"Excelente producto. Muy cómodos. Los he utilizado en 2 ocasiones para practicar senderismo, distancias entre 15 y 20 km. Tanto en tierra, agua, piedras o pavimento, todo muy bien. La suela es más gruesa de lo normal. Y sí son antiderrapantes."
Como siempre skechers sinónimo de comodidad y durabilidad recorrí 7 km de senderismo sin problema ejerce buen colchón y sigue tu trayecto lo que da mejor agarre y a la ves protege tus pies....
"Me gusto para correr en pasto y senderos, son cómodos y tienen bonito diseño y ligeros"
"Los ocupo para correr en pasto y terracería, repelente al Rocío del pasto, en lo personal valieron la pena,"
This is my second pair of Skechers and I'm please with the purchase
"SURPRISINGLY, AFTER 2 WEEKS OF JOGGING I NOTICED ITS HEELS WERE GETTING WORN OUT. I AM DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PURCHASE."
El producto cumple con lo que ofrecen y describen. hice una buena compra
Excelente producto. Recomendado al 100%
"I've been wearing Ecco's exclusively for nearly 10 years and bought these on a whim due to a really good price. They aren't quite in the Ecco category for comfort and form fit, but a good alternate shoe especially for the price. If you're an Ecco die hard, these feel a just a bit more narrow, and the heel of the shoe feels a bit lower, otherwise there isn't much to complain about. I would buy them again at the right price."
These are amazing. Except the tongue. It’s so weird it cuts into your ankle. I spent the $15 at my local shoe repair and had the tongue shortened and it was worth it. These things are comfortable!!!
"Love em!  Fit perfect, golfed in them right out of the box. Like wearing my running shoes.  Bargin of the century. First time having a small shoe size helped."
Was pleasantly surprised how cute and comfortable they are. Can’t wait to try them out on the course
"Very comfortable, good support.  My husband loves them!!"
Fit and wear is good.  Hasn't improved his game.
"Actually, I replaced the insole with my own one, but this is really good. Walking in green is very comfortable."
Great fit.  Great price.  Comfortable shoes
"Like:* They look really cool.* Fairly airy despite its enclosed design.* Slip on easy.* Good price (@ $25.00)Dislike:* After only having them for a week or two, the white peels off already in places.* They are wearing down fairly quickly as well.* I ordered a size 10, and they are closer to a size 11."
"…Like the other reviewers said, the white part at the bottom of the shoe is painted on and it peels off extremely fast if you want to use them without watching your steps carefully. I would recommend them for the price and for going to the pool or around town where you don’t have to worry about scuffing them. I find them comfortable and enjoy them, but I have to watch my steps and that detracts from the usefulness. I would buy again, but only solid coloured ones without the white strip at the bottom."
"I call these my field shoes. When I’m walking my dogs through the fields and the lawns in the summer, the dew soaks my shoes and wearing my barn boots looks a bit odd with shorts. These shoes are a perfect compromise - I can get them wet without worry and they look summery and cute. I’ve had more than a few compliments on them so I guess the neighbours agree that they are far superior to rubber barn boots for summer wear."
"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Shoes looks exactly as advertised.Dismiss the marking on the white part of the shoes, I spilled something on them. These shoes are comfortable and fit just right; there is no sliding around or slipping off my feet, not too tight either, no chafing. I like to quickly slip them on when I need to run out the door grab my contact free delivery (SkipTheDishes or DoorDash), take the garbage/recycle/compost out to the curb, waking around the yard and maybe some light garden work.They seem very durable, yet very flexible. That said the red part of the shoe is so flexible that if you’re  in a hurry and ramming your foot into the shoes…the heel part will fold under your heel if the shoe just fit. They are comfortable to wear as slip-ons with the back of the shoe squished under your heel but if you want to wear as a regular shoe, making the adjustment using your finger or wiggling your foot is quick and easy."
"I received the first time with manufacturing defects. Also, the size I usually take was a little too big for me. When I received the second replacement pair, another manufacturing issue was present, the white sole covering was peeling off after just one day. Product to be seriously avoided!"
La couleur est parfaite la bonne grandeur très satisfaisant mais par contre la bordure blanche ne restera pas longtemps sur la chaussure elle commence déjà à décoller par en droit et je les est porter qu’une heure dans la maison mais pour moi c’est pas tellement grave je vais m’en racheter l’année prochaine je suis trop bien 🥰
"I was looking forward to these shoes for a summer trip but they ended up being entirely too big and they were warped (probably from being squished for a long period during shipment). I think that maybe, if they had fit better, I would have worn them and the warp would have gone away, but no, I just threw them in a corner and eventually threw them out. :("
"We use these shoes as water shoes, garden shoes because they are so easy to clean.  They are so useful. You don’t dirty your runners when working outside.  I love them.  Also use them camping.  ♥️"
"They are cute but was slightly narrow for my toes. My small pinky toes hurt whenever I try to wear it but once you put lotion on your feet, it’s comfortable. I wish I can rate it 5 star but the quality isn’t good. The bottom sole is already thinned out after 5 uses. I live by the beach and I walk my dog every day. My left shoes sole is thinning that any minute now it will make a hole."
These are good for water but not that comfortable for walking in for extended period so i only use it for taking out to water so i dont have to hurt my feet stepping on barnacles. I got it on sale so its ok but I would not buy for full price.
"Purchased as a replacement for my kiddo. The adidas slides he previously had were small and worn out.  I purchased these as well as the same adidas slides just in a bigger size.  These have a soft fabric type top, which might make them a little more comfortable than the adidas that have a rubber top."
"Perfect fit, Very comfy. Holds up very well with my active 10 year old."
Comfortable fit as expected!
These puma slides were purchased for my  8 yr old grandson. He liked them very much.
My son loves them but its tolarge..it's to wide at the opening of the slipper.
"Nice looking boot, very comfortable. Good for dress or casual."
Fit and design is perfect
Great tri shoe
The best tri shoe I’ve ever worn.
"Ho comprato queste scarpe per poter iniziare a praticare un Po di  sport, visto la mia vita sedentaria non pretendeva chissà cosa, ma mi sono ricreduta. La scarpa si presenta come in foto senza alcun tipo di difetto, indossata al piede fa la sua figura. Io ho acquistato il 39 e devo dire che le misure corrispondono. Mi sento di consigliarla  a chi ha problemi di pianta larga perché davvero comodissima. Io ho scelto quelle verde acqua e rosa mi piacciono un sacco e  i colori sono vivi e sgargianti."
"Wow echt sehr angenehm überrascht. War ein Geschenk an meinen Freund. Er ist sehr kritisch mit Schuhen. Trägt sonst nur Nike oder Adidas. Er ist so begeistert, sagte dass diese Schuhe viel besser sind. Hatte sie auf der Straße und sofort im Fitness auf dem Laufband an. Er ist total begeistert. Will nur noch diese Marke. Der Preis von 34 € ist super fuer diese tolle Qualität. Chic und sehr gut verarbeitet. Ich habe Gr. 42 bestellt. 41 waere zu knapp und 41,5  gibt's nicht. Mit prime bestellt und nach 2 Tagen da. Wer diese Schuhe nicht kauft ist selber Schuld."
"Lieferung war wie immer super pünktlich. Mache ca 4 bis 5 mal Sport im Fitnessstudio. Hab immer wieder mit vielen anderen Sportschuhen die Probleme, das sie mir einfach zu schmal sind. Meine Füße brennen dan und ich muss die Schuhe ausziehen. Bei diesem Model ist alles bestens. Sie sind breiter geschnitten und haben eine rundere Form, auch schwitze ich nicht sehr in diesem Schuh. Für mich ideal. Den Preis finde ich super und auch die Optik ist klasse. Ich würde diesen Sportschuh für alle empfehlen, die einen breiteren Fuß haben und keine Marathon Läufer sind."
"Ich bin mehr als zufrieden; Denn da der Schuh so federleicht ist und eine leicht biegsame Sohle hat, hat man beim laufen oder gehen das Gefühl als würde man Schweben ! wurde auch schon gut positiv auf die schuhe drauf angesprochen, sehen ja auch noch sehr gut aus ...Der Preis ist günstig und ich kann nur weiter empfehlen"
"Tolle Schuhe zum günstigen Preis. Die Aussichten und das Design der Schuhe sind einzigartig und cool. Es ist recht leicht und der Komfort ist auch gut, man kann sie sowohl für den täglichen Gebrauch als auch zum Laufen benutzen.Darüber hinaus sind sie angenehm zu tragen und sehen gut aus. Auch Als Freizeitschuhe, sind sie absolut zu empfehlen"
"Sehr schöner Schuh, hab ihn 1 Nummer größer bestellt, war auch gut so. Nun sitzt er super. Einzig der Geruch stört. Der Schuh stinkt stark nach Chemie und muss nun erstmal lüften. Ansonsten ist er sehr leicht und bequem"
"Diese Schuhe habe ich zu Ostern meinem Mann bestellt sie passen wie beschrieben,  und Größe 43 passt , sehr leicht und schön.Allerdings, war die Beschreibung Dunkelblau, aber sie kamen in schwarz. Aber kann man ja auch zu allem tragen.Diese leichten Sneackers kann ich weiter empfehlen Sowie die Beschreibungen so stimmt dieser Schuh"
"Niente da dire sull'efficienza di Amazon nella puntualità della consegna. Le scarpe tuttavia mi hanno lasciato delusa. Sono state consegnate in una bustina, senza scatola, l'odore di plastica è molto forte anche a molte ore dall'apertura del pacco. Calzandole, le ho trovate un po' larghe e conferiscono al piede un aspetto non piacevole. Direi che per  30 euro si può avere di meglio."
"Me queda un poco grande, pero da igual, me sientan muy confortables, no es las que me esperada, existe la diferencia. Recomiendo que se compren un poco pequeño, saldrían perfecto."
"Meine Tochter hat sich die Schuhe ausgesucht und war vom ersten Tag an begeistert. Wenn es ginge, würde sie sie wahrscheinlich auch noch in der Nacht anziehen. Kaufempfehlung"
Tip top
Tallaje segun tablas bien.
Warm sneaker for winter ! Looked great and very cozy and comfortable . Not to replace snow wear.  My toddler grandson loved them . Great quality still look great .
"Very cute shoes! They fit my sons wide feet very well, and keep him warm!"
Sneakers do not come in a box and I'm actually questioning the authenticity of the product
Love the quality of these with the little Sherpa lining- adorable! My son loves them!
"Nice fits good, just the fur was a little dirty thought they were use at first .."
3 YO grandson loves them. Very Cute and perfect fit
"I like the good and solid construction as the color too. This pair of shoes will went many years. Surprise, these shoes are very slippery. I don't know if it is because they are new or other raison... An other surprise, the inside is flat and don't give a good support for the feet. My evaluation is a middle of the road. Not too good, not too  bad.."
"Zapatos muy bonitos, buena calidad, la talla fue la correcta, lastiman un poco si te los pones sin calceta ."
"El zapato tiene un diseño diferente al de la foto le falta una letra, N y la franja de la suela es más delgada a la de la foto la suela también es diferente"
"Buena calidad de los zapatos, la talla hay que saberla escoger porque las tallas americanas no son iguales a las mexicanas, el producto es bueno me gusto"

"Mi piacciono molto le scarpe , il venditore rapido , l'unica cosa , indossandole , visto che sono della in blu le pensavo più comode , risultano un po' durette ! La misura molto grande, quindi regolatevi ! Ho preso un 37 , mio numero abituale , decisamente molto comodo , di solito indosso un numero in più per questo tipo di scarpa"
These are so comfortable they feel like I'm wearing slippersVery stylish and well worth the money
Los mas cómodos para largas caminatas y largas jornadas de trabajo.
OMG!!! I so love this shoes! Fits perfect and so comfy!
These are extremely nice looking shoes. More like a dress shoe than a tennis shoe You could easily wear them to work which I do. However I’ve gotten a little spoiled with how comfortable sketchers are and the soles on these aren’t quite as cushioned. Still better than a normal shoe I guess.
"These shoes are very comfortable to wear.  I do not care for the taupe color though. I like the way the shoe looks otherwise. I was looking for a leather shoe though and this does not seem to be leather, it is so flexible. I love the ease for putting shoes on and taking them off by slipping them on and off. Great for someone with arthritis in their fingers and find it difficult to tie shoestrings. They arrived quickly and early."
"Love the style and color. They are so comfortable and stylist. Do slide on easily but are comfy once on. I have 10 pairs of Skechers, each a different style and they are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. LOVE MY SKECHERS!!!"
I had a similar pair to this.  What's not to love about them?  They are my winter go to run around shoe.  They always fit and were well.  I was looking for chocolate brown color and while this is lighter being dark taupe it works well.
"These shoes are very, very comfortable.  They fit true to size, and are good quality."
I like the ease of slipping my foot into the shoe. They are sturdy and stylish.
Not too attractive but very comfortable!

"After this purchase I'm not sure I'll purchase another pair of adidas with this pair being my first. The sneakers fit weird, as in the sizing. I am a 10 1/2- 11 in women. I has to order the sneaker three times and just gave up or in with a size 8 men. The sole has nice cushion, but the toes area doesn't as much like the sneaker has an incline making it uncomfortable to walk in for a long period of time. The style and colors I love. Hope I didn't confuse anyone maybe if it was in women sizes the fit would have been some what better but then again the sole is weird."
"Okay, Truth be told.. Originally found these Ultra Cool Adidas Ninja shoes at the 'Adidas Outlet Store"" in Cabazon, CA. HOWEVER, They did NOT have my correct size & were not able to ever get again. So, looked for lowest price all over the Internet. Was happy to find on Amazon for a decent price & did not get upset considering the $88.00 cost at Outlet Store... All I can say is  Thank You!  They fit Perfectly!  Very comfortable & snug as a glove. Great Color too!!  Peace & 💖 Andrew J.😊"
My husband had to have them for today and they arrived yesterday otherwise I would have returned them. They were very clearly a return as they were dirty inside including hair and one of the soles were out halfway and are super sticky on the underside so they are not supposed to be removed.
"Right from the get go put them on and wore them 8 hours. Even better than that orange/blue of the 2x foam I wear at work. If your knees are going out, like my knees, they are the shoes to wear.Adidas always seems to be a true fit for me , wearing a 9.5"
Fits bigger than the other 4 pairs of Adidas mens 10s I own. Seems about a half size bigger. Love the appearance but one part of the hot pink is coming unglued after 2 days of wear.
Super comfortable kicks and they look Awesome.
"There are no dislikes, every step is with cushion like feel. These have become my favorites."
I never had shoes this comfy. Definitely buy another pair.
Walking on clouds.
"The only shoes (after many tries) that worked for my early walker who has very bitty feet. Every other shoe he was stepping out of or able to pull off with ease. I'm grateful for these shoes...he loves them, too."
Too narrow hard to get on for a toddler
My son loves them. Said they were very comfortable.
Size 8 but they are smaller than the size 7 my son is outgrowing. Very disappointed.
These shoes are great for the price. Been loving Skechers shoes for my son (two now) since he started walking.
"Schicker Schuh, läuft sich gut."
Mieux que je ne l'imaginais. Très bonne taille. Bonne largeur. Reçu dans les délais. Bravo
Habe sie als Geschenk gekauft und sie sind sehr gut angekommen und super bequem! Gute Verarbeitung.
Trage diese Hausschuhe fast zwei Monate jeden Tag und sie sehen noch wie neu aus.Sie halten die Füße warm und sind durch die dicke Innensohle sehr bequem.
Die Hausschuhe sind sehr warm und tolle Leder Einlegesohle.Ich bin sehr zufrieden.
